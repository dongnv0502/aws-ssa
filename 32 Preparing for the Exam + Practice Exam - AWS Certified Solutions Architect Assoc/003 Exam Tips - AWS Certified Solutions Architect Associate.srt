1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,130
All right, so just a few exam tips,

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,430
just to make sure that you have the maximum chances

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,660
to pass your exam.

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,020
Number one, practice makes perfect.

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,590
So if you're new to AWS, maybe you're overwhelmed

6
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,810
by this course, so take a bit of AWS practice

7
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,643
thanks to this course.

8
00:00:12,643 --> 00:00:13,940
And don't rush to go to the exam.

9
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,980
Take your time, okay?

10
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,640
This is not a race, this is a challenge to you

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,970
to know that you know AWS, okay?

12
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,940
This exam recommends that you have one or more years

13
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,670
of hands-on experience on the AWS.

14
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,540
You can't fake that.

15
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,430
Now, you should be able to answer all the exam questions,

16
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,377
but hands-on experience is really how I learned AWS,

17
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:33,010
and this is how you should learn AWS, too.

18
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,960
Practice makes perfect, so give it a go.

19
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,520
Now, if you feel overwhelmed by this course

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,960
because you learned a lot of knowledge right now,

21
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,450
go through it one more time.

22
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,320
It is fine to take your time, okay?

23
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,140
There is so much new knowledge, even me,

24
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,110
I need to go back to it sometimes, so take your time.

25
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,490
Now when you do have questions, proceed by elimination.

26
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,690
So most questions are going to be scenario based,

27
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,530
they're going to be a bit long,

28
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,870
giving you hints and stuff.

29
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,910
And so for all the questions, first rule out answers

30
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,600
that you know for sure are going to be wrong.

31
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,550
This is really good way for you to maybe come back to

32
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,610
one or two answers, and then just know which

33
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,280
one is right, right away, okay?

34
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,860
So understand which one makes the most sense, okay?

35
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,230
Sometimes they are not that complicated,

36
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,970
so there is very few trick questions.

37
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,080
Maybe in the scenario they will try to lead you

38
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,700
into thinking something else because there will be

39
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,690
EBS, ASG, SSM, all these kind of technologies.

40
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,030
But there are very few trick questions,

41
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,200
and don't overthink your answers, okay?

42
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,570
If an answer seems feasible, but it's too complicated,

43
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,890
it's probably wrong.

44
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,040
So think about it, think about it real hard.

45
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,530
And if you don't know the answer of a question right away,

46
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,360
answer it, and then you can flag it for review later

47
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,420
using your little flag feature in the exam.

48
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,070
And so you can come back to it later,

49
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,880
and maybe you'll have the response then

50
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,620
because you have time to think about it.

51
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,550
I also recommend that you skim through

52
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,320
some AWS white papers.

53
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,570
And so you can read them, there's three of them

54
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,403
that I recommend.

55
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:55,190
Architecting for the Cloud: AWS Best Practices,

56
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,540
AWS Well-Architected Framework, and then finally,

57
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,860
AWS Disaster Recovery, and here's the link

58
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,020
because this one may be tough to find.

59
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,220
So overall I think we've explored the most important

60
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,830
concept in this course, but if you are interested

61
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,580
into these white papers, then it's never bad to look at them

62
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,413
or read them.

63
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:14,111
Maybe it will help you reinforce your learnings on AWS

64
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:17,050
and make you understand the course a little bit better.

65
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,970
Also, if you don't know a service very well,

66
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,120
or you have doubts, look at the service FAQ.

67
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,730
This is where most of the questions on the exam will be.

68
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,100
FAQ stands for frequently asked questions.

69
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,850
For example, if you look at VPC, this will be the URL,

70
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,070
amazon.com/vpc/faqs.

71
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,350
FAQs, as I said, cover a lot of questions that are going

72
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,440
to be asked on the exam, and it's really helpful

73
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,420
to look at it just to make sure that you understand

74
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,810
a service really, really well.

75
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,110
And finally, I think if you are really serious about AWS,

76
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,320
you need to get into the AWS community.

77
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,160
So do participate in this course,

78
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,883
answer other peoples' Q and A, help other.

79
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,630
Review questions that are asked by other people

80
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,730
just to make that you may be having the same questions,

81
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,100
and maybe you have the same doubts.

82
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,450
Maybe the answers will help you clear out your doubts.

83
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,300
And then do the practice test in this section.

84
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,830
You have to do it just to make sure you're ready.

85
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,510
Finally, there's some forums online, there's online blogs,

86
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,940
and there's even local meetups in pretty much every city

87
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,610
in the world to discuss with other AWS engineers.

88
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,480
And then if you're really into AWS,

89
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,080
you can also watch the re-invent videos.

90
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,630
This is Amazon's conference on YouTube,

91
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,780
and they're really, really great to get started.

92
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,330
So that's it for my tips.

93
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,250
I hope you're excited to pass the exam,

94
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,200
and I will see you in the next lecture.
