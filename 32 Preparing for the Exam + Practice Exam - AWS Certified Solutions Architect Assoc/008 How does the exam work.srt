1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,710
So a common question I get

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,240
is how will the exam work?

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,760
So first you register online, as I showed you.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,090
Then you pay $150 to sign up for the exam.

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,030
Then you provide one identity document on the day.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,590
So it could be your ID, your passport,

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,510
and all the details are in the email

8
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,570
that will be sent to you after you register for the exam.

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,620
You cannot take any notes.

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,850
You cannot use a pen.

11
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,720
You cannot speak.

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,570
And if you're at home, you will have to scan your room

13
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,700
to make sure it's fully empty.

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,080
Then we have 65 questions that will be asked in 130 minutes.

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,960
And in case you're not sure about a specific question,

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,330
you can use the flag feature

17
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,690
to optionally mark the question with the flag.

18
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,710
And at the end

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,170
when you can review all the questions and answer,

20
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,990
you can directly go back to the ones where you put a flag

21
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,950
to maybe answer it in a better way or verify your answer.

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,480
Once you submit the exam,

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,730
you cannot change any of your responses.

24
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,563
And to pass,

25
00:00:54,563 --> 00:00:59,190
you will need a score of at least 720 out of 1000

26
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,440
and you will know within five days

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,230
if you passed or failed your exam.

28
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,360
Most of the time, it's going to be less than five days

29
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,160
but it's not immediate.

30
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,310
You will know the overall score as well, a few days later.

31
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,193
So you'll receive an email notification

32
00:01:13,193 --> 00:01:14,940
telling you your score

33
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,300
to be downloaded on the certification website.

34
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,090
You will never know which answers were right or wrong.

35
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,310
This is so that people don't cheat.

36
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,260
And if you fail, you can take the exam again 14 days later.

37
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,450
So that's it, I wish you good luck for your exam

38
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,400
but I know you've prepared very hard.

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,260
Make sure to practice, practice, practice,

40
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,780
and revisit the lectures in this course

41
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,250
where you have some doubts.

42
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,563
That's it, I will see you in the next lecture.
