1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,890
Okay, so let's see how far we've learned

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,820
in this course,

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,570
and we're going to check the exam certification page

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,970
to have a look at the exam guide.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,960
So here I am

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,860
on the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate page.

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,910
And if you scroll down,

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,400
you can have a look at the exam guide

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,540
as well as the sample question.

10
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,670
So let's go over the exam guide.

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,910
So this is a long document at 17 pages

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,610
and it represents what you should be knowing

13
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,140
going into the exam.

14
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,330
So we're going to skim through this document

15
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,610
and verify that we know a lot,

16
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,010
and then I will do a few precisions,

17
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,790
especially when we go into this right here,

18
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,270
which is the services covered

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,050
which are at the very bottom, the appendix.

20
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,650
And this is concept that might be covered on the exam, okay?

21
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,630
So all these services here

22
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,060
will not necessarily be at the exam

23
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,470
and I've created the course in a way that's what I teach

24
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,540
I know is at the exam, okay?

25
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,130
So if you see something here

26
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,600
but I don't teach it in the course,

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,680
do not freak out.

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,700
If I hear from students that it is indeed at the exam,

29
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,280
then I will include lecture on it, okay?

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640
This is just technology that might be covered at the exam.

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,080
Okay, so let's go back up.

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,230
So you're going to have one year of hands-on experience

33
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,160
to do the exam,

34
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,330
but after doing this course

35
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,010
you will have enough experience.

36
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,410
So the exam will be of two types of question.

37
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,700
You have the multi-choice

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,270
where one correct responses and three incorrect responses,

39
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,260
and multi response

40
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,230
when you have two or more correct responses out of five.

41
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,320
And you must answer a question.

42
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,760
So there's no penalty for guessing.

43
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,650
You must answer every question,

44
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,980
because if you answer incorrect or if you don't answer,

45
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,450
you will not get points removed from your score, okay?

46
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,370
So answer all the questions.

47
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,610
There are 15 unscored questions that you do not know about

48
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,870
and they do not affect your score.

49
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,650
This is so that AWS can test new questions over time

50
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,483
and make sure they're good

51
00:01:59,483 --> 00:02:02,340
and make sure people answer them correctly or not,

52
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,330
but you don't know about them, okay?

53
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,990
So you're actually scored on 50 questions out of 65,

54
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,120
but 15 of them you don't know about.

55
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,960
Okay.

56
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,800
So your exam score is between 100 and 1000,

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,373
and the minimum passing score is 720.

58
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,690
Next you should have the content outlines.

59
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,580
So this is the domains at the exam.

60
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,800
So you have four domains you're being tested on.

61
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,650
And when you receive the final results,

62
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,060
it will tell you on each domain

63
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,550
if you were passing or not passing.

64
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,380
And it doesn't tell you your score per domain.

65
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,490
It will never tell you

66
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,590
if you're right or wrong on the question,

67
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,930
it will just tell you your total score,

68
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,350
as well as your domain level pass or not pass.

69
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,100
So 30% of the exam is on designing secure architecture.

70
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,900
So security is a big thing.

71
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,510
26% is resilient architecture.

72
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,750
So making sure we know about high availability and so on.

73
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,150
24% is high performance.

74
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,660
So how do we leverage the best service for the best use case

75
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,000
with the best features and the best options?

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,580
And finally cost-optimized architecture is at 20%.

77
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,670
How do we save on cost in the cloud?

78
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,503
Okay.

79
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:12,690
So here you can really have a look at each domain

80
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,280
and each knowledge of.

81
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,290
So I'm not going to read everything out to you,

82
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,360
that would be extremely boring, okay?

83
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,600
But I've designed this course in reading all the domains

84
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,700
and all the tasks and all the skills.

85
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,590
So really you should be good to go.

86
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,180
If there is something that you don't know

87
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,320
or don't feel confident about,

88
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,580
try to go back to the course,

89
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,660
or even better,

90
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,680
now you should know enough

91
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,470
to start looking into the AWS documentation

92
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,930
and really get the right information you need

93
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,910
to understand some services, okay?

94
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,230
So you have the four domains.

95
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,760
I invite you to read them in your own time,

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,520
otherwise that would be a very horrible video.

97
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,740
And then the appendix of services

98
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,920
that you can consider can appear at the exam

99
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,630
or might appear at the exam,

100
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,730
but you can hopefully rely on me

101
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,060
and say that, "I know what goes at the exam.

102
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,893
I've passed it."

103
00:03:57,893 --> 00:03:58,726
People have passed it

104
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:00,420
and I receive feedback all the time.

105
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,460
And so what I cover in the course should be enough.

106
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,570
And if I don't,

107
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,790
if you have something that is not covered in the course,

108
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,770
just please let me know and I will edit the course

109
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,940
as soon as possible.

110
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,520
But it's usually one question out of 65.

111
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,760
So it doesn't impact your ability to pass the exam.

112
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,800
I want you to have a very high score.

113
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,632
Okay.

114
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,050
So that's it for this lecture.

115
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,950
I hope you liked it,

116
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,899
and I will see you in the next lecture.
