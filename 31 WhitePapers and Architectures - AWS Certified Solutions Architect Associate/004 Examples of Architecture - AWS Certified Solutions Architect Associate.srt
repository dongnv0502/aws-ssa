1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,710
So in this course, I really try

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,080
to make it a huge differentiator for you

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,710
to actually see very important architectural patterns.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,200
To me, you can't do a solutions architect course

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,030
without seeing solution architecture.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,330
So we've explored architectures around classic, you know,

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,840
for example, EC2, ELB, RDS, ElastiCache, et cetera.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,570
And also, we've explored in-depth serverless,

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,557
more cloud native serverless architectures using S3, Lambda,

10
00:00:25,557 --> 00:00:29,640
DynamoDB, CloudFront, API Gateway, et cetera, et cetera.

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,729
But you may be hungry for more architectures.

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,860
And so if you wanna see more architectures,

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,690
there's two links on the AWS website,

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,890
which I think are really awesome

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,150
and not many people know about it.

16
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,670
So hopefully, I raise awareness on these links

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,600
through this course.

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,030
The first one is this link, and the second one is this link.

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,863
So you know what?

20
00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:47,490
We're going to visualize these links together

21
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,560
just to show you what they're about.

22
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,280
So here I am on the AWS Architecture Center,

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,113
and this is where you're going

24
00:00:54,113 --> 00:00:57,600
to find reference architecture examples and diagrams.

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,280
So if you scroll down, you get access

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,200
to different links, such as, for example, a link

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,450
to the Well-Architected Framework.

28
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,310
But let's scroll down even more.

29
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,200
In here, we can browse the contents

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,810
with all the architecture diagrams.

31
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,510
So as you can see, we have over 2,000 of those.

32
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,980
So this is huge.

33
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,980
And therefore, on the left-hand side, you have some filters

34
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,990
to select whatever you want.

35
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,440
So for example, here, if I automate your DR solution

36
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,320
for relational databases, I click on it

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,130
and I get access to this in PDF form or HTML form.

38
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,410
So let's access it in PDF form,

39
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,410
and you get access to a lot of information.

40
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,610
And within that information,

41
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,190
you will find some architecture diagrams

42
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,810
and everything is explained,

43
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,080
which I think is tremendously good resources

44
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,550
as a solution architect.

45
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,630
So it's very detailed.

46
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,030
As you can see, we have CloudFormation templates

47
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,700
that functions, I mean, everything is there.

48
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,970
You also have, for example, WordPress architecture.

49
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,880
So if you type WordPress, you have best practices

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,620
of WordPress on AWS.

51
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,463
Again, let's open the PDF version and scroll down.

52
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,213
And here we go again.

53
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:07,230
We have some architecture diagrams

54
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,150
and we have an even bigger architecture diagram.

55
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,770
So everything is quite thorough

56
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,860
and there's a lot of text that really helps you to step up

57
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,050
as a solution architect.

58
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,050
The other one I really liked is the AWS Solutions Library.

59
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,870
So this is vetted solutions and guidance for businesses

60
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,180
and technical use cases.

61
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,230
And I really like it

62
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,510
because it provides you not only architecture diagrams,

63
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,340
but also CloudFormation templates

64
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,200
to actually implement things.

65
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,990
So here, let's look at this AWS solution

66
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,170
called Live Streaming on AWS.

67
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,760
And here, this is how to build

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,870
a highly available architecture

69
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,600
that delivers reliable, real-time viewing experience.

70
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,430
Okay, perfect, let's scroll down,

71
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,840
and we get some information

72
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,400
around the type of solution we have.

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,940
So we have one on S3 and one on AWS,

74
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,250
which use different kind of services,

75
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,670
where they support, what they don't support and so on.

76
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,470
And then the technical details.

77
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,830
So we have the first architecture, the second architecture,

78
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,450
so they're both here.

79
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,970
And we can actually get implementation guides

80
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,640
and we can actually launch it in the console.

81
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,740
So there is a CloudFormation template,

82
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,600
the source being here,

83
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,200
and the source code is also on GitHub, as you can see.

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,450
And these CloudFormation template allow you

85
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,180
to actually develop and deploy these kind of architectures.

86
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,013
So this is awesome

87
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:27,570
because you really do a huge steps forward

88
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,420
as a solution architect into deploying some

89
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,470
of these solutions.

90
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,660
So if you scroll down on the solutions library,

91
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,470
you will find that you can browse by industry based

92
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,560
on what industry it is or cross industry solutions

93
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,530
or by technology or by organization type.

94
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,390
And finally, again, you have a lot

95
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,610
of filters on the on the left-hand side.

96
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,910
So if I type, for example, serverless in here,

97
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,300
I can find the Serverless Image Handler, which shows me

98
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,970
how to handle some images, such as smart cropping,

99
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,490
constant moderation, na, na, na, and so on.

100
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,140
And this is the architecture.

101
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,450
Again, there's a CloudFormation template.

102
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,490
You have an implementation guide and so on.

103
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,220
So everything is super well described,

104
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,390
and I really like these two resources

105
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,450
because they really propel you into the real world

106
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,250
of solution architecture.

107
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,420
So I hope you liked it,

108
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,493
and I will see you in the next lecture.
