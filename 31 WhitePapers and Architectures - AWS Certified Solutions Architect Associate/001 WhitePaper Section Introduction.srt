00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,380
Okay, so this section

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,520
is about studying the white papers

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,240
and a few architecture documents that we can have,

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,370
and these are actually not strongly required for the exam,

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,180
but you absolutely need to know a little bit

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,830
about the Well-Architected Framework

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,270
and Disaster Recovery and a few other things.

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,460
So this section is going to cover just that.

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,990
So we'll see the Well-Architecture Framework whitepaper,

10
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,570
and I'll be honest, I'll try to make this

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,010
as less boring as I can,

12
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,260
but it's not very fascinating for some,

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,724
the Well-Architected Tool, which I think is awesome,

14
00:00:27,724 --> 00:00:28,828
AWS Trusted Advisor,

15
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:31,430
some reference architecture resources,

16
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,680
and these are super-cool so don't miss that.

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,770
It's for the real world,

18
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,170
so these are to be links that we will need to use

19
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,922
as a real solutions architect,

20
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:42,556
and then finally, Disaster Recovery on AWS Whitepaper.

21
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:44,450
This one is a bit boring,

22
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,010
but it is super important going into the exam,

23
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,380
so we'll have to look at it,

24
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,700
and actually, you'll find this pretty interesting, I'm sure,

25
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,670
by the end of it.

26
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,270
All right, so let's get started.
