1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,123
So there is a framework

2
00:00:01,123 --> 00:00:04,200
called the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,880
And I'm going to describe it to you.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,600
This is a tool as well as a framework

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,480
that allows you to do good applications on AWS.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,440
So it's quite a long read

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,690
and so I try to summarize it for you in a few slides.

8
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,960
So the idea is that with the well-architected framework

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,140
once you implement the best practices,

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,730
then you go to outcomes,

11
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,430
and I'll give you the main guidelines of it.

12
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,480
The first one is that to stop guessing your capacity need

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,930
instead use auto scaling groups and so on.

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,140
Test systems at production scale.

15
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,010
So with AWS, you can very quickly perform big test

16
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,920
big infrastructure, and then shut them down an hour later.

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,900
So there's no reason for you not to test

18
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,520
at production scale.

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,990
Also automate that allows you to make

20
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,620
architectural experimentation easier.

21
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,200
If you have a Cloud formation template

22
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,240
you can easily deploy it

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,350
in multiple environments to experiments.

24
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,130
You can also allow for evolutionary architectures.

25
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,490
So your architecture can show over time it can start with

26
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,540
for example, EC2 instances and a load bouncer

27
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,540
and evolve towards a more serverless architecture such as

28
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,440
API Gateway and Lambda.

29
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,210
So design based on these changing requirements and so on.

30
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,040
Also drive architecture using data.

31
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,360
So data is very important.

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,230
You have to move it around storage and so on.

33
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,020
And finally, improve through game days.

34
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,650
The idea is that you must try out your architecture

35
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,640
good production, give it a go and see how you can improve.

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,722
So you need to submit your application, for example

37
00:01:31,722 --> 00:01:35,750
for flash sale days that put a lot of pressure

38
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,780
on your architecture.

39
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,120
So the architecture framework is six pillars.

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,400
The first one is operational excellence.

41
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,070
The second one is security.

42
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,980
The third one is reliability.

43
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,990
Fourth one, performance efficiency.

44
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,110
Fifth one, cost optimization.

45
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,390
And six one, sustainability.

46
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,400
So you have to know them all,

47
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,870
I mean, just the names, okay?

48
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,190
Not what they represent,

49
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,640
but the names are pretty explicit

50
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,050
and you can go on the website to learn more about them

51
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,130
but this is not the focus of this course.

52
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,530
And so these pillars are not something to balance

53
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,620
or trade off, they're actually a synergy.

54
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,580
For example, if you improve your operational excellence

55
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,380
you most likely will improve as well your cost optimization.

56
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,830
And if you are or more sustainable,

57
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,760
most likely you'll also be having

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,693
a higher performance efficiency and so on.

59
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,530
So to help you guide you through this framework

60
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,890
there is something called the AWS Well-Architected tool.

61
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,550
And it's a framework tool to review your architectures

62
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,810
against the six pillars I just defined.

63
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,930
And then you adapt architectural best practices.

64
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,030
So this is whether your looks like

65
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,360
and we'll see this in a second.

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,330
So how does it work?

67
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,330
Well, you select your workload

68
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,750
and then you answer questions.

69
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,750
You review your answers

70
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,620
against the six pillars that I just defined.

71
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,610
And then you obtain advice.

72
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,410
You get videos, documentation reports

73
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,170
and you see results in a dashboard.

74
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,930
So let's have a look to see how this tool works.

75
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,660
So here I am in the well-architected tool UI

76
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,810
and I'm going to define a workload.

77
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,580
So you can, for example, define a demo workload

78
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,717
and say this is your production application.

79
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:08,460
You can say, this is my prod application.

80
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,510
Okay, the review owner will be John@example.com.

81
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,520
We are in production and we are functioning

82
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,600
in two either of this regions that I will choose.

83
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,320
So this one and then US-West-2, perfect.

84
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,220
We can specify non-AWS regions, account IDs and so on.

85
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,120
And you can just specify a lot of information

86
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,660
around your infrastructure and architecture.

87
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,350
So next I'm going to apply lenses.

88
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,700
And these lenses are the kind of questions you apply

89
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,640
to your architecture.

90
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,070
So we'll apply the well-architected framework lens.

91
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,150
But you have the FTR lens, the serverless lens,

92
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,060
the SaaS lens and you can even create your custom lenses

93
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,060
if you wanted to.

94
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,400
But for now, we'll keep it simple

95
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,320
and just answer questions regarding

96
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,043
the well-architected framework.

97
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,083
So let's define the workload.

98
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,570
And once you have that, you need to start reviewing.

99
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,380
So we'll start reviewing and then we'll review

100
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,863
for the lens of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

101
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,070
So in here I get some resources on the right hand side

102
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,250
that I can close.

103
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,550
And the idea is that

104
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,560
you're going to have a lot of questions on the six pillars,

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,019
for example, 11 questions on operational excellence

106
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,980
and then 10 questions on security, six on sustainability

107
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,170
and things can change over time, of course

108
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,600
but the idea is that you answer questions

109
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,570
and then you're gonna get recommendations.

110
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,740
So for example, how do you determine that

111
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,250
what your priorities are?

112
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,980
And we'll say, okay, we evaluate governance requirements

113
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,610
external customer needs and trade offs.

114
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,630
And then next, so answer one question.

115
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,400
And then how do you structure your organization?

116
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,250
Maybe I just have this answer and then next.

117
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,710
And so you can answer questions in the various pillars

118
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,840
and you should answer them all for all pillars,

119
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,710
but let's answer one as well

120
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,230
in performance efficiency, randomly and next.

121
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,800
So once you answer maybe three questions of course

122
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,733
they're a lot more, then you save and continue.

123
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,270
And then here, as you can see, we have three high risks.

124
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,500
So you can click on this lens right here

125
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,220
and then you're going to get the overview of this lens

126
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,900
as well as the risks.

127
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,810
So you can click on the risk itself

128
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,690
by going to improvement plan.

129
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,360
We see we have three high risk and zero medium risk

130
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,270
and so this one was a high risk

131
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,290
and here are the recommendations regarding this risk.

132
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,090
So I need to evaluate internal customer needs

133
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,790
evaluate threat landscape and so on.

134
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,970
And then if I click on it, I get the section

135
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,630
in the framework itself that tells me exactly

136
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,700
what I need to do.

137
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,720
So it's very important.

138
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,300
And then I will go back to answering more questions

139
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,100
and making sure that this is addressed.

140
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,470
And so this tool just gives you feedback.

141
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,160
And over time you can define milestones.

142
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,530
You can look at your improvement plans and so on.

143
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,320
And the idea is that once you are very confident

144
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,880
that this framework works for you

145
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,850
then your application is production ready

146
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,950
and your workload is compliant and well architected, okay?

147
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,240
So that's it for this tool.

148
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,200
I hope you liked it

149
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,150
and I will see you in the next lecture.
