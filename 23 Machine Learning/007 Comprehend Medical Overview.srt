1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,080
So now let's talk about

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,030
Amazon Comprehend Medical.

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,120
So Comprehend Medical detects and returns

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,270
useful information in unstructured clinical text.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,640
For example, if your doctor is taking notes,

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,110
or if you have discharge summaries,

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,340
or test results, or case notes, then it will use NLP.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,910
So it will use natural language processing to detect

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,320
all the protected health information

10
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:28,417
within the document itself as well with a DetectPHI API.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,290
So from an architecture perspective

12
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,900
you would store whatever documents you have in Amazon S3,

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,050
and then you would invoke the Comprehend Medical API.

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,090
Or you could have Kinesis Data Firehose,

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,890
and then analyze that in real time.

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,510
Or you can use Amazon Transcribe

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,810
to first transcribe the voice into text.

18
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,340
Okay, as we understand from before.

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,200
And then once it's in text form

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,620
we can pass it to the Amazon Comprehend Medical service.

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,770
So let's have a look into the consult to see how that works.

22
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,787
So I am in the Amazon Comprehend Medical service,

23
00:00:58,787 --> 00:01:01,740
and let's launch a real time analysis.

24
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,470
So here it's Input text.

25
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,650
And so imagine that this is doctor's note and he wrote

26
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,750
or she wrote all these things, right?

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,580
So the doctor, okay, wrote all this.

28
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,590
Now let's analyze it.

29
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,140
And from this, we can have entities.

30
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,680
And so you can find an age, and an high school teacher,

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,530
and then you can find some overlap between some things

32
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,048
such as there was a procedure name and the time

33
00:01:25,048 --> 00:01:26,607
to the procedure name and the date and so on.

34
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:30,060
And as you can see all this data become quite organized.

35
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,570
And so you have like some generic name of a molecule

36
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,790
and its strength and dosage and route modes

37
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,170
and frequency and so on.

38
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,990
And this allows you to really start structuring

39
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,960
all your health data from unstructured text

40
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,640
using machine learning.

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,413
So you can explore this, okay,

42
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,360
but I'm not gonna go into the details of this.

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,480
This is a medical field that I'm not very confident with,

44
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,280
but at least you know that thanks to

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,940
Amazon Comprehend Medical you can take information

46
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,930
in text form and then get insights out of it.

47
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,040
So I hope you liked it.

48
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,990
And I will see you in the next lecture.
