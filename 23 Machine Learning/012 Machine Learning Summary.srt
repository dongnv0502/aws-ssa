1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,193
Now let's talk

2
00:00:01,193 --> 00:00:03,600
about the machine learning services on AWS,

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,939
and you have to remember them all going into the exam.

4
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,030
So Rekognition is a way for you to do face detections,

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,910
to do labeling, and celebrity recognition.

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,910
Transcribe is for you to get a way to get subtitles,

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,700
for example, to convert your audio into text,

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,440
whereas Polly is the opposite.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,650
It allows you to get to use your text

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,780
and create audio out of it.

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,390
Translate is for you to get translations.

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,660
Lex is to build conversational bots or chatbots,

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,820
and if you bundle it with Connect,

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,850
then you can create a cloud contact center.

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,810
Comprehend is a way

16
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,570
for you to do natural language processing.

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,750
SageMaker is a fully featured machine learning service

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,930
that is accessible to developer and data scientist.

19
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,680
Kendra is going to be an ML-powered document search engine.

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,730
Personalize is used

21
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,470
for real-time personalized recommendations

22
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,730
for your customers,

23
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,530
and Textract is used to detect text

24
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,430
and data and extract them from various documents.

25
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,290
So hopefully, you can remember this whole list.

26
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,480
This will get you a few points at the exam.

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,500
I hope you liked this lecture,

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,450
and I will see you in the next lecture.
