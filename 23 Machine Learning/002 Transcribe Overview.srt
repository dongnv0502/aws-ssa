1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,940
So now let's talk about Amazon Transcribe.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,170
So as the name indicates,

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,980
it allows you to automatically convert speech into text.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,440
So you pass in some audio

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,140
and automatically is going to be transcribed into text,

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,850
so you could say, hey, hello,

7
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,120
my name is Stephane and I hope you're enjoying the course.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,953
Now, how does it do it?

9
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:22,050
Well, it uses a deep learning process called the ASR,

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,600
the Automatic Speech Recognition,

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,560
to convert speech to text very quickly and accurately

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,150
and there are a few features you need to know about.

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,350
The first one is that you can automatically remove any PII,

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,400
so personally identifiable information, using reduction.

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,450
So that means, for example,

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,440
if you have someone's age or name or Social Security Number,

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,660
this can be automatically removed

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,820
and also you can have access

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,020
to automatic language identification for multilingual audio.

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,850
So if you have some French and some English,

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,010
some Spanish, Transcribe is smart enough

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,530
to recognize all of those.

23
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,690
So the use cases for Amazon Transcribe

24
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,000
is to transcribe customer service calls,

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,760
to automate closed captioning and subtitling,

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,620
and also to generate metadata

27
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,223
for media assets to create a fully searchable archive.

28
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,850
So let's have a look at Amazon Transcribe.

29
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,120
So I can create a transcript and I can see

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,210
that the specific language right now is set to English US,

31
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,060
so now if I click on start streaming,

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,073
hello, I really like this course.

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,360
As you can see, the outcome of the audio

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,910
get directly transcribed into some text,

35
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,350
so that's pretty cool, right?

36
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,380
Also, you can have the setting to remove some content

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,780
and you can remove PII identification.

38
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,310
So I could say, hey,

39
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,340
you can identify and redact it to remove it

40
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,770
and these are the kind of things that can be removed.

41
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,930
So for example, let's have an example

42
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,850
and try it out, so I won't show this all again.

43
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,870
Hello, my name is Stephane, I am 31 years old

44
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,870
and my phone number is 910-747-280

45
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:09,930
and as you can see now, the things got hidden.

46
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,930
So my name is hidden and my phone is hidden.

47
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,300
Obviously this was not my real phone number.

48
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,590
You cannot try it.

49
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,510
Okay and last thing I want to show you

50
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,180
is that you can actually stream into multiple languages.

51
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,760
So you have automatic language identification.

52
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,400
So I would choose English and French

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,843
and then let's start again.

54
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,503
Hello, this is some recognition happening in English.

55
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:40,591
(speaking in French)

56
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,920
Pretty awesome, right?

57
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,840
Well, that's it for Amazon Transcribe.

58
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,250
If you wanted to play some more,

59
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,470
you can have a look at all the options in the bottom,

60
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,640
but that's it for this lecture.

61
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,733
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
