1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,410
So now let's talk about Amazon Textracts.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,810
And Amazon Textract is used to extract texts,

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,380
so, hence the name.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,070
So you extract text, handwriting,

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,870
or data from any scanned document

6
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,180
and behind the scenes, of course,

7
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,660
uses AI or machine learning.

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,980
So we have, for example, a driver license,

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,637
and then we upload it into Amazon Textract,

10
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:22,070
and then, automatically, will be analyzed,

11
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,870
and the results will be given to you as a data file,

12
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,280
and so you'll be able to, for example,

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,260
extract the date of birth, document ID, and so on.

14
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,833
So you can extract any data, even from forms and tables,

15
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:37,010
and you can read PDFs, images, and so on.

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,570
So the use cases for extracting texts are multiple,

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,490
but you could be for financial services

18
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,090
to process invoices or financial reports,

19
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:44,990
could be for healthcare,

20
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,290
for medical records, and insurance claims,

21
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,619
or for the public sector, for example, for tax forms,

22
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,890
ID documents, and passports.

23
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,723
So that's it for this lecture,

24
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:54,810
I hope you liked it,

25
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,760
and I will see you in the next lecture.
