1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,560
Now let's talk about Amazon Translate.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,260
So Translate, as the name indicate,

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,110
is a natural and accurate language translation.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,030
Translate allows you to localize content,

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,070
for example, your websites and your application,

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,930
for your international users

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,340
and easily translates large volume of text efficiently.

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,207
So for example, say in English, I say,

9
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:19,700
"Hi, my name is Stephen,"

10
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,780
In French, it would be. (speaking in foreign language)

11
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,220
In Portuguese, it would be. (speaking in foreign language)

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,590
And in Hindi, it would be. (speaking in foreign language)

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,730
Okay, I just showed off.

14
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,610
So that was it, super easy service.

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,443
I hope you liked it.

16
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:35,330
And I will see you in the next lecture.
