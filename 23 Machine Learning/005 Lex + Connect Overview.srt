1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,480
So now let's discuss Amazon Lex and Connect.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,624
So Amazon Lex is the same technology that powers

3
00:00:06,624 --> 00:00:09,570
the Alexa devices by Amazon.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,690
And if you don't know Alexa, Alexa is like a little device

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,807
that you have in your home and you say,

6
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:15,900
"Alexa, what's the weather like tomorrow?"

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,150
And it will reply, "The weather is good,

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,303
it'll be 24 degrees and it'll be sunny."

9
00:00:20,303 --> 00:00:22,535
So, the idea is that with Amazon Lex,

10
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:26,430
you get automatic speech recognition, so ASR,

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,870
that allows you to convert speech,

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,570
so spoken words, into text.

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,770
There's also a very good thing

14
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,520
because Lex understands the intent of text, callers

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,590
by doing natural language understanding,

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,510
so it understands sentences.

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,160
And Amazon Lex is a technology

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,940
that will help you build chatbots or call center bots.

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,320
And talking about call centers,

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,700
how do we build a call center?

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,530
We have Amazon Connect.

22
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,619
So Amazon Connect is a visual contact center

23
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:54,900
that allows you to receive calls, create contact flows,

24
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,490
and it's all cloud-based.

25
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,695
And it can integrate with other customer

26
00:00:58,695 --> 00:01:01,332
relationship system, management systems, so CRMs

27
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:03,510
or AWS services.

28
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,903
And the cool thing about Amazon Connect versus traditional

29
00:01:05,903 --> 00:01:08,460
offering is that there is no upfront payment.

30
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,632
It's about 80% cheaper

31
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,750
than traditional contact center solutions.

32
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,500
So the whole flow of building a smart contact center is

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,180
that you will have, for example,

34
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,910
a phone call to schedule an appointment that is made

35
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,520
into a number that is defined by Amazon Connect.

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,170
So they call Amazon Connect.

37
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,980
Lex is streaming all the information from this call

38
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,593
and understand the intent of the phone call,

39
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:35,220
and therefore, it will invoke the right lender function.

40
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,840
And that lender function, for example,

41
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,707
can be very smart and say, "Hey, someone has said

42
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:42,060
to schedule a meeting tomorrow with Tom at 3:00 PM."

43
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,616
Okay, I will go into my CRM and schedule that meeting

44
00:01:44,616 --> 00:01:46,860
by writing some code.

45
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,870
So this is the whole idea behind Lex and Connect.

46
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,550
So remember Lex is for ASR

47
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,830
and Connect is for contact centers.

48
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,663
So that's it.

49
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:56,213
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
