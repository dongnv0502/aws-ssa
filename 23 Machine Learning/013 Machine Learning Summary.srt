1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,410
Now let's talk about

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,600
the machine learning services on AWS,

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,920
and you have to remember them all going into the exam.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,020
So, recognition is a way for you to do face detections,

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,900
to do labeling, and celebrity recognition.

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,630
Transcribe is for you to get,

7
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,870
a way to get subtitles.

8
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,680
For example, to convert your audio into text.

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,410
Whereas Polly is the opposite.

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,950
It allows you to get,

11
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,780
to use your text and create audio out of it.

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,370
Translate is for you to get translations.

13
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,630
Lex is to build conversational robots or chatbots.

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,810
And if you bundle it with Connect,

15
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,850
then you can create a cloud contact center.

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,190
Comprehend is a way for you

17
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,560
to do natural language processing.

18
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,730
SageMaker is a fully featured machine learning service

19
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,810
that is accessible to developer and data scientist.

20
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,720
Forecast allows you to build highly accurate forecast.

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,480
Kendra is going to be an ML-powered document search engine.

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,200
Personalize is used for real-time

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,530
personalized recommendations for your customers.

24
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,860
And Textract is used to detect text and data,

25
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,240
and extract them from various documents.

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,090
So, hopefully you can remember this whole list.

27
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,290
This will get you a few points on the exam.

28
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,300
I hope you like this lecture,

29
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,250
and I will see you in the next lecture.
