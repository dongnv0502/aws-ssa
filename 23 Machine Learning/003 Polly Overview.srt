1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
[Narrator] - Polly is the opposite of Transcribe.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,030
You turn text into speech using deep learning.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,910
This allows you to create applications that will talk.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,787
For example, it says,

5
00:00:09,787 --> 00:00:11,190
"Hello, my name is Stephane

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,380
and this is a demo of Amazon Polly."

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,600
And then with Polly, it would generate an audio,

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,280
which I can play right here.

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,270
Hi.

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,050
My name is Stephane and this is a demo of Amazon Polly.

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,790
I think I'm better at speaking than that

12
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,070
but (chuckles) this gives you a good demo, right?

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,010
And you can play with it on the console.

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,630
So Amazon Polly can do more.

15
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,820
It can use Lexicon & SSML

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,090
so the first one is to customize the pronunciation

17
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,270
of words with Pronunciation lexicons.

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,690
For example, if there is a stylized word such as Stephane

19
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,750
but the E is a 3 and the A is a 4

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,040
the Amazon Polly image might say "S-T-3-P-H-4-N-E,"

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,050
which is not how it should be pronounced;

22
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,370
it should be pronounced Stephane.

23
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,160
And so, therefore, you can create a lexicon for this.

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,830
Or for example, for acronyms, for example, any time

25
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,700
it sees AWS, instead of saying "A-W-S"

26
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,580
it should say the full "Amazon Web Services."

27
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,200
So then you upload the lexicons

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,830
and you use them in the SynthesizeSpeech operation.

29
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,300
The second feature you need to know about

30
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,520
is the SSML feature,

31
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,760
which is called Speech Synthesis Markup Language.

32
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,690
And this enables more customization to how speech is made.

33
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,010
So you can, for example,

34
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,730
emphasize on specific words or phrases,

35
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,130
or you use phonetic pronunciation,

36
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,800
or you want to include breathing sounds or whispering,

37
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,800
or you want to use the Newscaster speaking style.

38
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,620
So all of it can be used using this Markup Language,

39
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,010
and so instead of generating the speech from plain text

40
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,070
you can include a whisper and it will start whispering,

41
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,660
and so on, okay?

42
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,770
So, remember, for pronunciation of stylized words

43
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,710
or acronyms, use Pronunciation lexicons.

44
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,890
And for more customization

45
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,520
on how words are being pronounced, for example,

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,850
whispering or phonetic pronunciation, and so on,

47
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,463
then use the SSML Markup Language.

48
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,330
So if I go into the Amazon Polly service,

49
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,600
this is where I can turn text into lifelike speech.

50
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,890
So we can try it.

51
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,880
So we can use, for example, the neural network, okay.

52
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,490
And this is the most natural and human-like speech possible

53
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,200
and we can choose the voice we want.

54
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,610
So, here's the text.

55
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,990
So I will say, "Hey, my name is Stephane

56
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,880
and I love AWS."

57
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,990
Let's see what happens.

58
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,093
So if we listen to this, it will say:

59
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,020
Hi, my name is Stephane and I love AWS.

60
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,520
So that's pretty cool, right?

61
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,330
And here with SSML, and so, for example, let's add a break,

62
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,510
so I will say, "Hey, my name is Joanna,"

63
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,770
and then I open a break.

64
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,600
I say, "Break time equals,"

65
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,450
and this is part of the SSML Language,

66
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,540
and then slash

67
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,690
and this.

68
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,110
So I say, "Hey, break this for three seconds."

69
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,730
So it would say:

70
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,400
Hi, my name is Joanna.

71
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,500
Now there's a break.

72
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,010
I will read any text you type here.

73
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,130
And this is how you control the speech itself

74
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,173
using the SSML Markup Language.

75
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,782
And lastly, if we want to say,

76
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:22,090
"Hey, I love

77
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:26,700
AWS" right here, so we say, "I love AWS,"

78
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,220
and we'll just have one second of break.

79
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,090
Let's listen to this.

80
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,553
Hi, my name is Joanna.

81
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,520
I love AWS.

82
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,160
Okay, what if you want to say, not AWS,

83
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,670
but Amazon Web Services, in which case you would need to go

84
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,540
into additional settings and then customize pronunciation.

85
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,610
And here you would need to apply lexicon

86
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,610
and upload lexicon to convert AWS into Amazon Web Services.

87
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,740
So, trust me, you just need to create a file,

88
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,840
and then upload it, create a lexicon,

89
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,390
and then automatically whatever you set as, for example,

90
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,430
whenever it will find AWS,

91
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,160
it will just say Amazon Web Services.

92
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,960
And that's it for Amazon Polly.

93
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,910
You should know everything there is to know for the exam.

94
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,870
I hope you liked it

95
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,820
and I will see you in the next lecture.
