1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,620
So welcome to the AWS Console Home.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,820
And in this page, you can do a lot of things.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,540
So first of all, let's have a look

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,590
at the top right corner of your screen,

5
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,840
right now, this is what's called the regions selector,

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,930
and right now I am in Northern Virginia,

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,210
US east one.

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,660
But it is advised for this course to

9
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,910
choose a region that is geographically close to you.

10
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,850
So because I'm in Europe, I'm actually close to Ireland.

11
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,020
So I can choose EU west one.

12
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,987
But if you are in other regions of the world, for example

13
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:28,630
if you're in Africa and you're close to Capetown

14
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,800
then choose this.

15
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,492
Of course you don't have to physically be

16
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:33,551
in that region to use that region, okay?

17
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:34,630
You can for example

18
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,750
choose whatever region makes sense for you.

19
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,660
So choose whatever is closest

20
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,840
and this will give you the lowest amount of latency.

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,580
Next in the console console, you will see a list

22
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,260
of recently visited services

23
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,490
and it should be empty for you.

24
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,340
And I just tried that one

25
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,960
so it's showing one right here for me.

26
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,530
On the bottom you get some information about AWS.

27
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,990
You get the health issues, if need be

28
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,370
and cost and usage info for your accounts

29
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,600
as well as tutorials to build a solution and so on.

30
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,590
So this webpage is actually changing a lot over timeless

31
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,480
changed a lot for the past two years.

32
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,170
And so it may not look exactly the same as you

33
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,340
and in case it looks very, very, very different.

34
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,010
I will rerecord this lecture.

35
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,900
Okay, so once we have this

36
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,340
we need to look at services of AWS.

37
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,690
And for this two options,

38
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,150
the first one is to go on the top left click on services

39
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,200
and you can either look at services

40
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,530
by alphabetical order, as you can see

41
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,450
there are a lot of services on AWS,

42
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,790
or by category for example, for compute

43
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,070
you will have all these services and so on.

44
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,240
But don't worry over time,

45
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,110
we will learn these services

46
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,840
and we don't have to navigate that page.

47
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,130
Another thing I really like is the search bar.

48
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,210
So you can actually type a service for example, route 53

49
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,830
and then it gives you search results.

50
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,560
So it gives you four services that match this query, okay?

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,930
And then within these services,

52
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,710
we can also have a look at features

53
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,120
and 13 features match them.

54
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,070
So we can directly jump into the domain names

55
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,750
of the route 53 service and it's a good thing.

56
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,970
We can also look at blogs, knowledge articles

57
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,020
documentations and so on.

58
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,853
So this is quite cool.

59
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:13,320
Let's go into route 53 now to have a look at this console.

60
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,680
So this one is very special because

61
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,140
on the top right hand side, it says global.

62
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,810
That means that this console

63
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,110
does not require a region selection.

64
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,310
And that is more of the exception than the rule,

65
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,680
but some services in AWS are where

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,650
it's called global services and no matter where you are

67
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,010
you're going to get the same view.

68
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,940
But if you switch services and you go, for example

69
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,573
to the EC two service,

70
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,170
this time on the top right hand side,

71
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,590
as you can see it says Ireland

72
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,950
because I chose the Ireland region.

73
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,100
And so based if I run this console in Ireland

74
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,130
or say in another region, for example, in Canada,

75
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,780
well my view is going to be different

76
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,850
in terms of the resources that I will see.

77
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,820
So that's why it's important for you to remain

78
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,700
within the same region for the entire duration

79
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,440
of this tutorial and this course.

80
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,690
The other thing you can look at

81
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,360
is called the AWS global infrastructure

82
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,980
that you can find on Google.

83
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,910
And this gives you a lot

84
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,480
of information around your services.

85
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,700
And one thing that is very important to look at

86
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,320
is the AWS regional services.

87
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,757
And it gives you the services list by region.

88
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:19,550
And so this is table,

89
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,010
and so for example, if in the course,

90
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,340
I talk about a service and do a hands on,

91
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,560
but it doesn't seem to be in your region,

92
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,610
you can check here and find the availability of services.

93
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,030
So for example, we can check a look,

94
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,140
have a look for Cape town

95
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,280
and see the services that are available in this region.

96
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,800
And if you don't see a service

97
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,750
maybe you need to switch a region

98
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,530
in of course the console,

99
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,740
to have access to it

100
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,913
because not all the services from AWS are in every region.

101
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,490
So that's it for this lecture,

102
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,430
I hope you liked it

103
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,380
and I will see you in the next lecture.
