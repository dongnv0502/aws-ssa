1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
Now let's look at the history

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,990
of the AWS Cloud.

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,189
It was launched in 2002 internally at amazon.com

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,140
because they realized that the IT departments

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,360
could be externalized.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,000
Their Amazon infrastructure was one of their core strengths

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,967
and they said, you know what?

8
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:19,650
"Maybe we can do IT for someone else, for other people."

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,200
So they launched their first offering publicly,

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,620
which was SQS in 2004.

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,880
In 2006, they expanded their offering

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,880
and they relaunched with the availability of SQS S3 and EC2.

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,920
Don't worry, we'll see all these services in this course.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,367
Then they expanded and said, you know what?

15
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:38,520
"We don't have to be just in America.

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,870
We could be in Europe."

17
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,710
And then fast forward to today, we have so many applications

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,350
that used to run, or are still running on AWS,

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,700
such as Dropbox, Netflix, Airbnb, or even the NASA.

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,850
Now let's look at where AWS is today.

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,690
If you look at the Magic Quadrant from Gartner,

22
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,140
you can see that AWS is a leader,

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,573
and it has been the case for many, many years.

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,820
AWS now has $90 billion in revenue as of 2023,

25
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,240
and it accounts for about 31% of the market in Q1 2024,

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,750
with Microsoft being second with 25%.

27
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,900
It's been a pioneer and a leader of the market

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,690
for 13th consecutive years,

29
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,610
and it has over 1 million active users.

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,860
So, learning AWS really sets you up

31
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,110
for success in the cloud world.

32
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,730
What can you build on AWS?

33
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,761
Well, pretty much everything.

34
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,960
AWS will enable you to build sophisticated

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,580
and scalable applications,

36
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,910
and they are applicable to a diverse set of industries.

37
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,910
Every company has a use case for the cloud.

38
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,820
Netflix, McDonald's, 21st Century Fox, Activision,

39
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,350
they're all using the cloud.

40
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,940
And use cases can include

41
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,130
just transferring your enterprise IT,

42
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,770
or using the cloud as a backup and storage,

43
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,840
or doing some big data analytics.

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,910
You can also host a website,

45
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,800
or create a backend for your mobile

46
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,720
and your social applications,

47
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,910
or you can have your entire gaming servers

48
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,170
running on the cloud.

49
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,900
The applications are endless.

50
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,300
Now, AWS is global,

51
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,270
and this is where we are going to learn a bit more specifics

52
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,680
about how it works.

53
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,070
We have AWS regions, we have availability zones,

54
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,160
data centers, edge locations, and points of presence.

55
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,030
And all of these can be represented on the map right here.

56
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,210
Let's go on this website to have a quick look at it.

57
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,320
This is a cool map,

58
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,010
because on this website we can see how AWS is global.

59
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,410
If I click on it, I can scroll the world

60
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,090
and see what is happening.

61
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,610
We can see that AWS has multiple regions,

62
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,640
and they're in orange and they're all around the world.

63
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,960
For example, Paris, in Spain, in Ohio, in Sao Paulo,

64
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,844
Cape Town, Mumbai, and everywhere else.

65
00:02:51,844 --> 00:02:55,980
AWS truly is a global service.

66
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,160
On top of it, each region are going to be connected

67
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,180
through the network.

68
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,400
These are the network reconnecting the regions,

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,680
and this is a private network of AWS.

70
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,650
And then within each region, for example,

71
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,100
if I really scroll into the Cape Town region,

72
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,380
we can see that we have blue dots,

73
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,660
and each blue dots will be availability zones

74
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,060
that will be describing in the next slide.

75
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,250
As we can see, what I want to get you out of this

76
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,990
is that AWS truly is global,

77
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,560
and we can leverage the infrastructure of a cloud provider

78
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,380
to make ourselves, or application global.

79
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,740
The first important concept in AWS are regions.

80
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,470
Regions are all around the world, and we saw it on the map

81
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,870
from before the regions have a name.

82
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,350
It could be US-east-1, EU-West-3,

83
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,080
and we can see the mapping of the name of the region

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,220
to their code on the console that we'll see in a minute.

85
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,290
Now, a region, what is in its truly...

86
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,780
Well, it's going to be a cluster of data centers.

87
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,090
Many different data centers look at it in near,

88
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,170
for example, Ohio, or Singapore, or Sydney, or Tokyo.

89
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,000
When we use AWS services,

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,850
most services are going to be linked in scope

91
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,350
to a specific region.

92
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,170
That means that if we use a service in one region

93
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,060
and we try to use it in another region,

94
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,540
it will be like a new time of using the service.

95
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,550
Now, a question that may come up in the exam

96
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,190
is how do you choose an AWS region?

97
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,230
Say you're launching a new application,

98
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,430
where should you do it?

99
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,920
Should you do it in America, in Europe,

100
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,560
in South America, or in Australia?

101
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,960
Well, the answer is of course, it depends.

102
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,170
But let's look at some factors that may impact your choice

103
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,820
of an AWS region.

104
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,560
The first one is compliance.

105
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,040
Sometimes governments want the data to be local

106
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,410
to the country you're deploying the application in.

107
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,360
For example, France,

108
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,460
data in France may have to stay in France,

109
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,950
and therefore you should launch your application

110
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,033
in the French region.

111
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,930
Then there is also a concept of latency.

112
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,510
If most of your users are going to be in America,

113
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,300
it makes a lot of sense to deploy your application

114
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,830
in America close to your users,

115
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,260
because they will have a reduced latency.

116
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,940
If you deploy your application in Australia,

117
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,830
and your users are in America,

118
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,920
they will have a lot of lag using your application.

119
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,090
Then also, not all regions have all services, okay?

120
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,490
Some regions do not have services,

121
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,860
and so obviously if you're leveraging a service

122
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,630
with your application, you need to make sure

123
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,360
that the region you're deploying into is available,

124
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,030
and does have that service.

125
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,280
And finally, pricing.

126
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,040
Pricing does vary from region to region,

127
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,867
and you need to consult the appli...

128
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:33,240
The services pricing pages to see

129
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,400
what the differences are between the regions.

130
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,320
But this could be obviously a factor

131
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,030
that could impact your deployment

132
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,403
of an application into a specific region.

133
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,220
Now, availability zones are

134
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,250
what actually are going into the region.

135
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,350
Each region will have many availability zones,

136
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,680
usually three, the minimum is three, and the max is six,

137
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,170
but really the usual is three.

138
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,810
So let's take the Sydney region as an example.

139
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,110
The Sydney region code is ap-southeast-2.

140
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,140
We have two have three availability zones in Sydney,

141
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,350
ap-southeast-2A, ap-southeast-2B,

142
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,690
and ap-southeast-2C.

143
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,980
Now, each of these availability zones are going to be one

144
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,080
or more discrete data centers

145
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,710
that will have redundant power networking and connectivity.

146
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,050
That means that in southeast-2A,

147
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,480
I can have two data centers maybe as well,

148
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,430
2 and 2B, and 2 and 2C.

149
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,050
But it could be one, it could be three, it could be four.

150
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,240
We don't really know, it always doesn't tell us that.

151
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,080
But what we know is that these availability zones

152
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,820
are separate from each other

153
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,430
so that they will be isolated from disasters.

154
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,460
If something happens to ap-southeast-2A,

155
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,940
we know that it is designed not to cascade

156
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,390
into ap-southeast-2B, or ap-southeast-2C.

157
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,400
They're really isolated from disasters.

158
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,520
And then these data centers, these availability zones,

159
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,130
they are connected with high bandwidth,

160
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,370
ultra-low latency networking, and therefore,

161
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,350
altogether being linked together,

162
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,810
it will form a region.

163
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,770
Okay, next, the only thing we need to know about AWS

164
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,270
for the global infrastructure

165
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,970
is the points of presence or edge locations.

166
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,370
We will see them in details in the global section

167
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,900
of this course, but you should know

168
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,680
that AWS has more than 400 points of presence in 90 cities,

169
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,540
across 40 countries.

170
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,880
And this will be very helpful when we deliver content

171
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,790
to the end users with the lowest latency possible.

172
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,280
And this is what you see on this map.

173
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,810
Now, again, I'm going quickly over this

174
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,400
because we'll see this at the...

175
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,500
About the middle of this course.

176
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,660
Now how about we just play around

177
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,820
and do a tour of the consult?

178
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,360
We'll see that AWS has global services such as IAM,

179
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,270
Route 53, CloudFront and WAF,

180
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,790

181
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,210
are going to be region scoped, such as Amazon EC2,

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,450
Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, and Rekognition.

183
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,320
