1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,050
So now let's talk

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,510
about the Network Load Balancer.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,520
So it's a layer 4 load balancer,

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,910
and therefore it allows you to deal with TCP

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,620
and UDP traffic.

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,950
Okay, this is lower level, layer 7 was HTTP,

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,670
and layer 4 is going to be TCP and UDP traffic.

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,000
So these work for the Network Load Balancer

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,390
and therefore when in the exam you see UDP,

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,940
think Network Load Balancer or even TCP.

11
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,460
Okay, also on top of it,

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,140
the Network Load Balancer

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,180
is really, really high performance,

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,930
and therefore it can handle millions of requests per seconds

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,570
and it has ultra-low latency.

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,530
Now, another specificity of the Network Load Balancer

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,060
is that it only has one static IP per availability zones,

18
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,530
and you can assign an elastic IP to each AZ.

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,460
So this is very helpful

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,800
when you need to expose your application

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,830
with a set of static IPs,

22
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,840
and this can be elastic IPs.

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,777
So in the exam you say,

24
00:01:01,777 --> 00:01:05,340
"Hey, your application can only be accessed within one, two,

25
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,780
or three different IPs,"

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,200
then you need to think about the Network Load Balancer

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,700
as an option.

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,700
So if you see extreme performance TCP or UDP, or static IPs,

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,200
think Network Load Balancer.

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Now using it is not included in the AWS free tier.

31
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,740
So let's have a look at how that works.

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,390
So it works very similarly to the application balancer.

33
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,400
We create target groups,

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,450
and then the network balancer will redirect to them.

35
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,010
So we can use, for example, the TCP traffic

36
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,530
or, for example, in the backend HTTP,

37
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,513
but still in the front end use TCP.

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,020
So what about the target groups?

39
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,700
This is the important parts.

40
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,640
So the target groups can be EC2 instances.

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,970
That means that your Network Load Balancer can redirect

42
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,710
to your EC2 instances and send TCP or UDP traffic to them.

43
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,410
But you can also register IP addresses,

44
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,730
and these IP addresses,

45
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,160
when they're hardcoded and they must be hardcoded,

46
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,139
they must be private IPs.

47
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,070
So why would you do this?

48
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,520
Well, you can of course send the private IP

49
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,950
of the EC2 instance that you own,

50
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,440
but also you could use the private IP

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,170
of a server that you have in your own data center,

52
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,960
and therefore both of them can be fronted

53
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,273
by the same Network Load Balancer.

54
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,790
And it's also possible for you

55
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,110
to have a Network Load Balancer

56
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,260
in front of an Application Load Balancer.

57
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,370
So in that case, the NLB is in front of your ALB.

58
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,050
So why would you do this?

59
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,300
Well, thanks to the Network Load Balancer,

60
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,660
you would get, for example, the fixed IP addresses,

61
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,240
and then, thanks to the Application Load Balancer,

62
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,370
you can get all the rules that you have

63
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,190
around handling HTP type of traffic,

64
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,500
so it is a valid combination.

65
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,300
Now one last thing you need to know for the exam

66
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,820
is that the health checks performed

67
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,700
by the Network Load Balancer target groups

68
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,120
are support three different kind of protocols.

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,380
They support the TCP protocol, the HTTP protocol,

70
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,810
and the HTTPS protocol.

71
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,290
So if your backend application supports the HTTP

72
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,730
or HTTPS protocol,

73
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,350
then it is definitely possible for you

74
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,610
to define a health check on these protocols.

75
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,100
Okay, so that's it for the Network Load Balancer.

76
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,100
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
