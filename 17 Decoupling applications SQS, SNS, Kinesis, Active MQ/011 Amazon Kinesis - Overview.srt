00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,580
Welcome to this section on Kinesis.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,540
So Kinesis at the Certified Developer exam

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,320
is something you need to know in depth,

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,900
so I'm going to spend a lot of time

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,290
describing how each service works

6
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,740
to really give you that in-depth expertise

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,990
to allow you to score the maximum amount of points

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,030
at the exam.

9
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,380
So let's start with an overview of Kinesis.

10
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,030
Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process,

11
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,570
and analyze streaming data in real time.

12
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,340
So the real-time data could be anything,

13
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,470
such as application logs, metrics,

14
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,700
website clickstreams, IoT telemetry data.

15
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,870
As long as the data is generated fast and in real time,

16
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,460
this counts as a real time stream of data.

17
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,293
So there are four services that comprise Kinesis.

18
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:39,990
There's Kinesis Data Streams

19
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,130
that we'll explore really in depth

20
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,240
to capture, process, and store data streams.

21
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,630
There is Kinesis Data Firehose to load data streams

22
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,310
into some data stores in AWS, but also outside of AWS.

23
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,440
There is Kinesis Data Analytics to analyze data streams

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,260
with the SQL language or Apache Flink.

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,880
And finally, a service that doesn't appear at the exam

26
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,670
but still good to mention is Kinesis Video Streams

27
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,990
to capture, process, and store video streams.

28
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,430
So this was just a very high-level overview.

29
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,280
In the next lectures,

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,640
we'll be exploring one of these services one by one

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,473
and making sure

32
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,650
we get the right amount of knowledge on them.

33
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,550
So I will see you in the next lecture.
