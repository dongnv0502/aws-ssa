1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,750
So just a very short lecture

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,460
around a scenario that can come up in the exam.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,720
And the idea is that you want to have Snowball

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,140
import data directly into Glacier,

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,550
but Snowball cannot import data directly into Glacier.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,460
The solution for you is to use Amazon S3 first,

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,290
and then you would create a lifecycle policy

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,360
to transition these objects into Amazon Glacier.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,030
So once you know, it is very simple.

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,630
Snowball imports the data into Amazon S3

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,390
and thanks to an S3 lifecycle policy,

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,300
the data is transitioned into Amazon Glacier.

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,920
That is something to remember for the exam.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,873
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
