1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,960
So here is a quick hands-on

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,820
on the Storage Gateway but you don't need to know

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,950
how to configure one for the exam,

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,783
just you need to know

5
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:09,280
the different kinds of offerings you have.

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,110
And so, that's what I'm going to show you in this console.

7
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,370
So, let's create a gateway.

8
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,060
As you can see, we have four different kinds of gateways,

9
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,610
we can have Amazon S3 File Gateway, FSx File Gateway,

10
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,980
Volume gateway, and Tape gateway.

11
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,980
So, the Amazon S3 File Gateway

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,010
is to have a local cache for Amazon S3 on-premises

13
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,690
with your most recently used data

14
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,820
so this is the whole purpose of a file gateway.

15
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,890
And if you click on Next,

16
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,610
you can look at the Platform options.

17
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,290
So, you can either host this

18
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,700
on some on-premises virtualization platforms,

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,670
such as VMware or Hyper-V, or Linux KVM,

20
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,780
or you can host it directly on Amazon EC2,

21
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,480
but it's going to remove someone as the benefits

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,460
for caching.

23
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,200
Or you can have your own hardware appliance

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,180
that you can order directly from here.

25
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,520
And then once you hook that hardware appliance

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,710
into your data center,

27
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,720
you'll be running a file gateway for you,

28
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,890
which is quite handy.

29
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,380
So once you do set up for example in EC2 instance,

30
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,213
then you click on Next

31
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:05,030
and you would configure the gateway, which is out of scope.

32
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,910
I just want to show you the main options.

33
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,320
So the Amazon FSx File Gateway is the same as free,

34
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,900
but this time you want to cache

35
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,350
the windows file server directly on-premises.

36
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,610
And again, we have different platform options,

37
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,780
including a hardware appliance, if we wanted to.

38
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,790
And then we would configure the FSx file gateway properly.

39
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,060
The Volume gateway is very interesting

40
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,190
because we have two options.

41
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,910
And that's what I want to show you in this hands-on.

42
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,720
So we have the cached volume,

43
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,990
which is going to give you low-latency access

44
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,290
to your most recently used data for your volumes

45
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,040
or storage volume, which is on-premise data

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,650
with scheduled upside backups.

47
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,740
So two very different use cases for Volume gateway,

48
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,360
and you need to know the differences going into the exam.

49
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,230
So the Volume gateway is going to use you block storage

50
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,120
in Amazon S3 and point-in-time backups as EBS snapshots,

51
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,700
so that they are actually volumes.

52
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,620
And finally, the tape gateway

53
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,380
is allowing you to backup your data into Amazon S3

54
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,900
and archive it into Glacier

55
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,040
using your existing tape based processes,

56
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,870
because it uses the same protocol that you're used to

57
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,853
with your VTL.

58
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,009
So that's it for your different storage gateways.

59
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,600
I hope you liked it, I hope it makes sense

60
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
and I will see you in the next session.
