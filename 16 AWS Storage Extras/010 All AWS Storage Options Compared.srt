1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,780
So there are lots of storage options on the AWS,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,250
all with their different use cases.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,990
And I wanted to give you a short lecture

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,300
to just summarize what we've seen

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,920
and then understand what are the differences.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,900
So we've seen Amazon S3.

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,940
It is for Object Storage

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,210
And we've seen it's a very specific API, okay?

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,960
But it's great for anything related to AWS.

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,540
And then should we want to archive these objects,

11
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,293
we can use the S3 Glacier service.

12
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:32,293
Now, if we want to attach storage to one EC2 instance

13
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,770
at a time, we could use EBS volumes.

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,500
And we saw EBS volumes have a little feature

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,190
called multitask for the IO1 and IO2 volumes.

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,023
And within EBS,

17
00:00:42,023 --> 00:00:44,070
we saw that they were different kinds of volumes.

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,690
We had the GP3 volumes,

19
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,860
we had the IO2 volumes,

20
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,060
and so on.

21
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,760
If we wanted to get super high performance,

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,204
physical storage for your EC2 instance with very high IOPS.

23
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:56,054
But if this is not a network storage,

24
00:00:56,054 --> 00:00:57,330
if this is the physical storage,

25
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,810
then we need to use the EC2 Instance Storage.

26
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,270
Now, if we wanted to get a Network File System

27
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,650
for Linux instances,

28
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,160
that could be mounted across multiple availability zones

29
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,690
with the POSIX filesystem,

30
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,590
then we should use the Amazon EFS service.

31
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,590
Now, if you wanted to have a Windows server file system

32
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,830
we need to use the Amazon FSx for Windows service.

33
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,663
If you wanted to get

34
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:26,220
very High Performance Computing Linux file system

35
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,410
that's compatible with a Lustre client,

36
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,990
then we need to use FSx for Lustre.

37
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,860
If you wanted to get

38
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,230
super High Operating System Compatibility

39
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,360
for a network file system,

40
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,620
we could use the FSx NetApp ONTAP file system.

41
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,280
And you want to get a managed ZFS file system,

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,740
we could use FSx for OpenZFS.

43
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,600
So we've seen all the flavors.

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,900
Now we have other ways to bridge storage

45
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,420
between on premises and AWS,

46
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,860
we have the Storage Gateway.

47
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,170
So we sell the different types of storage gateway.

48
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,230
We have the S3 and the FSx File Gateway

49
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,690
to synchronize files between on premises

50
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,570
and Amazon S3 or Amazon FSx.

51
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,449
We have the Volume Gateway to mount volumes

52
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,640
onto your on premises servers

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,530
but have them backed up in the cloud.

54
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,350
And we have the Tape Gateway to just do backups

55
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,940
in the tape form.

56
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,320
If you wanted to have a FTP, FTPS, or SFTP interface

57
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,170
on top of Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS,

58
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,100
then you would use the AWS Transfer Family.

59
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,460
And if you wanted to synchronize data on the schedule

60
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,030
from on premises to AWS, or AWS to AWS,

61
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,790
you would use the DataSync service.

62
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,810
And finally,

63
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,290
if you don't have the network capacity to move data,

64
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,320
but you want to move large amount of data physically,

65
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,622
then you would order a Snowcone, a Snowball,

66
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:51,180
or a Snowmobile type of device

67
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,060
into on premises and then move it to the cloud.

68
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,305
With the particularity that Snowcone comes

69
00:02:56,305 --> 00:03:00,150
with a data sync agent bundled in it already.

70
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,430
And also I would not pass Databases

71
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,530
so you can store it on Databases

72
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,870
but there are sort of very specific workloads

73
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,880
usually need indexing and querying

74
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,160
and we'll have a whole section dedicated

75
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,200
to understanding the right Database.

76
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,540
So hopefully when you see these storage,

77
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,190
you understand their differences

78
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,330
and you'll be able to understand

79
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,340
which one is the right one at the exam.

80
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,330
I know this is a lot,

81
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,920
but this is part of your role

82
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,170
as a Solutions Architect on AWS

83
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,810
to understand the differences between all the storage

84
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,540
and choose the right one for the right architecture.

85
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,373
Okay. That's it.

86
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:32,206
I hope you liked it.

87
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:34,140
And I will see you in the next lecture.
