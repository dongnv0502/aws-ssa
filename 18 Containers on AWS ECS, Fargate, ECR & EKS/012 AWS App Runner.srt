1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,350
So now let's talk about

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,540
the AWS App Runner service.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,820
It's a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,760
web applications and APIs at scale

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,700
and with this, anyone can deploy to AWS.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,150
You don't need to know anything about infrastructure,

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,000
for containers or your source code or whatever you want.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,340
So the idea is that you start with your source code

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,650
or a Docker container image

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,450
and then you're going to configure the settings.

11
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,550
So it shows how many VCPS you want,

12
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,350
how much memory you want for your containers,

13
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,840
if you want autoscaling and a few health checks.

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,960
So some basic settings to define your web application

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,500
or your API, and then automatically, that's it,

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,400
it will start building

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,160
and deploying the web app using the App Runner survey.

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,130
So the container will be created and deployed,

19
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,950
and then your API or your web app is deployed

20
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,550
and you can access it right away using a URL

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,520
and so, as you can see, there was no knowledge whatsoever

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,620
of what goes on underneath.

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,460
Underneath, of course, uses the AWS services, but as a user,

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,750
you just don't know about it.

25
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,830
So it's very quick.

26
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,319
So with App Runner, you get a lot of goodness,

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,140
you get automatic scaling, it's highly available,

28
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,460
you get load balancing,

29
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,950
you get encryption and your application,

30
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,867
your container can also get access to your VPC.

31
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:16,350
That means that you can connect to your databases,

32
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,010
your cache, as well as your message queue services.

33
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,460
So the use case for this is to very quickly deploy web apps,

34
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,210
API, microservices, and do rapid production deployment

35
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,680
with best practices, all using the AWS App Runner service.

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,000
It's a very simple service.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,820
It does very simple things, but it's very powerful.

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,620
Okay, that's it, I hope you liked it

39
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,570
and I will see you in the next lecture.
