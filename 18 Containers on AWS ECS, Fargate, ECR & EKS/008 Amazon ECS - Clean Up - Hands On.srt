1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,040
So let's make sure to destroy everything

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,240
before we're done.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,060
So first, we need to stop the service.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,990
So to stop the service,

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,640
make sure you have zero tasks running.

6
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,170
If not, you update the service

7
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,510
and you set the desired task to zero.

8
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,110
And then you can click on Delete Service, type in Delete,

9
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,210
and this will delete the service.

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,410
Now, when you delete the service,

11
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,610
this is actually going to go

12
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,880
into a service called CloudFormation.

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,460
And CloudFormation is going to take its time

14
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,820
to delete the entire stack that it created.

15
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,410
And so part of the thing it's going to delete

16
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,620
is the ECS service, but also you LoadBalancer Listener,

17
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,930
you LoadBalancer itself, the security group,

18
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,310
and the target groups.

19
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,140
So this can take a little bit of time

20
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,840
and we need to wait for everything to be deleted.

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,580
And when the service is fully deleted,

22
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,980
then you can go and delete this cluster.

23
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,140
So for this, you just click on Delete Cluster

24
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,340
and it's going to delete the demo cluster.

25
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,350
And we can do this right now.

26
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,850
And again, this is going to start something

27
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,120
in CloudFormation to delete the infrastructure

28
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,860
of the ECS cluster.

29
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,600
So that includes the capacity provider,

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,820
the auto-scaling group that we have created,

31
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,070
the cluster, and the launch templates.

32
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,510
So this is very good.

33
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,660
Finally, for your task definition, you can leave them as is.

34
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,540
They don't cost you any money, they're just definitions.

35
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,373
But if you wanted to,

36
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:19,860
you could also click on one of them and deregister.

37
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,830
Do Action and deregister the test definition itself.

38
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,663
So that's it.

39
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:26,703
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
