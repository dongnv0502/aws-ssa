1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,050
So, now, let's talk

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,410
about AWS App2Container or A2C.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,290
So, it's a CLI tool that is used to migrate

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,420
and modernize Java and .NET

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,790
web applications into Docker containers.

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,260
The idea is that you wanna do a migration.

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,381
It's called a lift-and-shift migration,

8
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:18,000
where your apps are running on premises

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,140
on whatever you have, for example,

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,270
bare metal or visual machines,

11
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,360
and then you migrate it to AWS.

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,850
And so, the idea is that you accelerate modernization,

13
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,132
but you don't change any code

14
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:30,240
and you migrate legacy apps this way

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,090
to the cloud without doing any code changes.

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,350
So, this will in the end,

17
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,180
generate a CloudFormation templates

18
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,280
for your compute, your network, and so on.

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,460
It will also register the generated Docker containers

20
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,703
into Amazon ECR,

21
00:00:42,703 --> 00:00:43,980
and then you can choose

22
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,520
to deploy to ECS, EKS, or App Runner.

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,940
And this supports as well prebuilt CI/CD pipelines.

24
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,670
So, the idea is that you're going to use the CLI to discover

25
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,846
and analyze which apps can be migrated.

26
00:00:56,846 --> 00:00:59,855
Then, everything's going to be extracted and containerized.

27
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:03,244
Then, the deployment artifacts are going to be generated.

28
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:04,965
That means that there's going to be

29
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:07,440
a CloudFormation templates with ECS Task

30
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,240
and EKS Pod definitions,

31
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,270
anything CI/CD if needed, and other infrastructure.

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,920
And then, deployed to AWS.

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,200
So, the image of the Docker container

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,450
is going to be stored in Amazon ECR,

35
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,220
and then deployed anywhere you want

36
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,950
on ECS, EKS, or App Runner.

37
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,680
So, the very simple concept to remember in this instance

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,777
that if you want to migrate a web application

39
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:31,627
using Java or .NET to AWS very simply,

40
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:34,410
then you should use AWS App2Container.

41
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,243
And that's it.

42
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:38,430
That's the level of detail required for the exam.

43
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,263
All right, that's it.

44
00:01:39,263 --> 00:01:41,980
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
