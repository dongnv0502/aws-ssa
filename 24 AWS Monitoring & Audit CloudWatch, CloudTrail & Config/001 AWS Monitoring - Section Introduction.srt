00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,470
OK so we have our application it's in the cloud.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,520
It's running.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,990
And your manager calls you at 2:00 a.m. and say it's not running anymore.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,580
What happened?

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,290
Well we've deployed her application but we forgot to turn on monitoring.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,160
Monitoring is so important and it will make sure that your applications are running the right way.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,990
Such as you can see what's happening with the logs with the metrics with tracing and audits who made what's

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,340
in your AWS infrastructure.

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,020
This section is so important because as a developer.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,680
I never deployed an application in AWS without enabling some kind of monitoring.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,790
I know you're excited to learn about monitoring!

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,320
Let's go.
