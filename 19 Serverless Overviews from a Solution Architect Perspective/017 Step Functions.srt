1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,073
Now let's learn

2
00:00:01,073 --> 00:00:04,170
about the AWS Step Functions.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,330
So, Step Functions is a way for you

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,570
to build a serverless visual workflow

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,980
to perform orchestration,

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,890
and it's usually of your Lambda functions.

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,450
So you would design a graph,

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,970
and you would say at each step of the graph,

9
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,650
in case of success or failure, what goes on next?

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,550
And this is really cool,

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,120
because you can start really having some complex workflows

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,830
within AWS.

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,260
So Step Functions have some internal features,

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,410
such as sequencing, parallel functions, conditions,

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,780
timeouts, error handling, and so much.

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,510
And it doesn't just do Lambda functions.

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,510
It is actually integrate with EC2 instances, ECS tasks,

18
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,530
On-premises servers, the API Gateway,

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,270
the SQS queues, [00:00:47 NMADB],

20
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,320
and actually a lot of AWS services.

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,150
Also, it is possible for you

22
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,220
within the Step Function workflow

23
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,590
to implement a human approval feature.

24
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,110
For example, a workflow goes up to some points,

25
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,990
and you say, okay, a human will have a look at the results.

26
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,480
And if the human says "Yes," then please go on.

27
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,190
If "No," then fail.

28
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,210
This is something that's possible

29
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,890
thanks to the Step Functions.

30
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,020
So the use cases of Step Functions are manifold,

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,530
but, like, we can have, for example, the order fulfillment.

32
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,350
We can have data processing, web applications,

33
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,020
or any kind of workflow that is complex

34
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,600
to describe and that would require some sort

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,330
of graph for you to visualize it, okay?

36
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,490
So that's it for this little intro.

37
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,360
I hope you liked it.

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,403
And I will see you in the next lecture.
