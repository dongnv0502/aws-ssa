1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,520
So you need to know a few Lambda Limits

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,660
before going into the exam,

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,840
because the exam likes to see if you know these limits

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,200
and these limits are per region.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,930
So we have some execution limits

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,780
and then we'll have some deployment limits.

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,180
So execution is that the memory allocation

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,010
is between 128 megabytes to 10 gigabytes.

9
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,890
And this is in 64 megabytes increments.

10
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,830
And when we increase the memory,

11
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,670
then we have more vCPU, you understand this now.

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,670
The maximum execution time is 900 seconds

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,860
which is 15 minutes.

14
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,300
So anything above that is not a good use case for Lambda.

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,470
Environment variables,

16
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,160
we can only have up to four kilobytes

17
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,993
of environment variable,

18
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:39,760
so a little bit amount of space.

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,230
But there is a temp space

20
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,510
if you want to pull in some big files

21
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,430
while we create another function.

22
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,840
And so this is this capacity in the /tmp folder

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,670
and we have up to 10 gigabytes there.

24
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,320
We can have up to 1000 concurrent executions

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,430
over Lambda functions.

26
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,610
This can be increased as well if we do a request.

27
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,260
But it's good to use reserved concurrency early on.

28
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,629
Finally, for deployments,

29
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,600
the max size for your compressed zip is 50,

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,600
uncompressed, it is 250 megabytes.

31
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,160
So anything above that, for example, big files,

32
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,800
you should use a /tmp space instead.

33
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,633
So as I said,

34
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:19,450
in case you need to have a big file (mumbles),

35
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,360
please use that directory.

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,193
And finally,

37
00:01:22,193 --> 00:01:24,990
again, the environment variables is four kilobytes.

38
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,810
So once you know all these limits,

39
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,040
when the exam will ask you a few questions

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,420
such as we need 30 gigabytes of RAM,

41
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,620
or we need 30 minutes of execution time,

42
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,050
or we need a big file of three gigabytes,

43
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,980
then you will know that Lambda is not the right way

44
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,560
to run this workload.

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,900
I hope that was helpful,

46
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,850
and I will see you in the next lecture.
