1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,950
So now let's do a short lecture

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,600
on RDS Custom.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,540
So, we know that with RDS we don't have access

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,440
to any underlying operating system, or customization,

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,930
but with RDS Custom we actually do.

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,600
And RDS Custom is for two database types,

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,620
it's for Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,980
In which, thanks to RDS Custom, we have access to the OS,

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,080
and database customization.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,270
So with RDS, we still get all the benefits

11
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,190
of automated setup, operations,

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,009
and scaling of the database in AWS.

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,020
But with the RDS Custom option,

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,030
the custom part of RDS Custom,

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,490
we actually have access to the underlying database

16
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,810
and operating system.

17
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,690
So we can actually configure internal settings,

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,540
install patches, enable native features,

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,110
and we can actually access the underlying EC2 instance

20
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,790
behind RDS, using SSH or SSM Session Manager.

21
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,670
So here is my EC2 instance, and as a user,

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,430
we can now, if it's using Amazon RDS Custom,

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,400
apply customizations and SSH into it.

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,220
To perform any customization it is recommended

25
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,770
to deactivate the automation mode,

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,170
so that RDS does not perform any automation,

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,180
or maintenance, or scaling, or whatever you want,

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,280
while you perform your customization.

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,010
And also because you may actually break things,

30
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,920
because now you have access to the underlying EC2 instance,

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,050
it is much better to take a database snapshot,

32
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,830
otherwise you will not be able to recover from your actions.

33
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,710
So to summarize, RDS versus RDS Custom.

34
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,960
RDS will manage your entire database,

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,430
and your operating system.

36
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,070
Everything is managed by AWS, you don't have to do anything,

37
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,350
and RDS Custom, it's for Oracle

38
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,600
and Microsoft SQL Server only,

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,550
and you have actually full admin access

40
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,000
to the underlying operating system and the database.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,160
So that's it for this lecture, I hope you liked it,

42
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,113
and I will see you in the next lecture.
