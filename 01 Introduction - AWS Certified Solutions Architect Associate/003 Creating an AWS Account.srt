1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,610
So let's go ahead and create an AWS accounts.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,890
And the first thing you have to do,

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,100
is to specify a route user email address

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,460
which is your main email address.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,360
And they will be used to log to your Amazon accounts.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,890
On top of it, you can specify a name for account.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,833
For example, stefane-demo-v3.

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,970
After verifying your accounts,

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,020
you have to set a root user password

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,370
and confirm this root user password.

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,370
If you lose your root password,

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,620
you can recover it,

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,600
thanks to your email, but it is better for you not to forget

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,130
about your email address and your root user password.

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,940
Next, you specify that this is a personal accounts

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,310
and you enter your details for this accounts.

17
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,310
Next, you have to enter credit card details

18
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,470
and you will get an authorization

19
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,270
of $1 onto this credit card.

20
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,920
So this is not a charge, is a pending transaction

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,340
and it's just an authorization that will be canceled.

22
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,730
And as long as you remain within the Free Tier,

23
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,710
you will not be charged.

24
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,670
But if you go over the Free Tier, then you will be charged.

25
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,720
And I will show you of course

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,459
how out to monitor for these things.

27
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:05,519
But if you follow this course,

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,940
you should remain within the Free Tier limits.

29
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,160
After that step, you must confirm your identity

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,610
by providing a phone number and then receiving

31
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,750
either SMS or a voice call to confirm that phone number.

32
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,880
Then you must choose a support plan

33
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,330
and will use the basic support free for this course,

34
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,190
because that's all we need.

35
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,760
Then you complete the signup,

36
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,760
and congratulations you are signed up for AWS.

37
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,420
It will take a few minutes to activate your account

38
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,430
and you'll receive an email when this is complete.

39
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,820
In the meantime, you can click

40
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,580
on go to the AWS Management Console.

41
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,420
You must enter your root user email address

42
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,120
and your password, and then you are logged

43
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,100
in into the AWS Console.

44
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,700
Congratulations, let's get started with this course.
