00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,120
Hello and welcome to the AWS certified solutions

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,710
architecture associate course.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,820
My name is Stéphane Maarek

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,860
and I will be your instructor for this course.

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,510
So I'm delighted to have you here.

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,800
We're going to start in five minutes

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,020
so please pay attention to this lecture.

8
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,580
So we are going to prepare

9
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,107
for the solutions architect exam of code SAA-C03

10
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:22,257
and it's a challenging, yet super interesting certification.

11
00:00:22,257 --> 00:00:24,960
And this course will cover everything you need to

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,490
know to pass the certification.

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,600
So this course is long.

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,700
It's about 25 hours long

15
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,890
but I will make sure it's my promise

16
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,830
to you to keep it as interesting as possible along the way.

17
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,970
You will learn a lot.

18
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,850
I expect you to know some basic things about IT.

19
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,990
Although I will teach you a few things

20
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,760
along the way and be sure of one thing

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,570
I will teach you everything you need to know about AWS.

22
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,820
So this course contain videos from my other courses

23
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,880
such as the AWS certified Cloud Practitioner course,

24
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,490
Developer and SysOps course, because there's a shared amount

25
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,520
of knowledge between all the AWS courses.

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,560
So if you hear me say some keywords

27
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,270
or talk about the wrong exam

28
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,970
don't worry you are in the right place, nonetheless

29
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,970
but there is a very exciting query section in this course

30
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,500
actually more than one section

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,840
but it's dedicated to solution architecture.

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,130
And so we will do a deep dive on this in this course.

33
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,260
We will cover over 30 AWS services in depth.

34
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,420
So you will learn a lot

35
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,330
And finally, if you're a beginner in AWS

36
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,620
you are more than welcome.

37
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,850
Just take your time with this course.

38
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,530
It's not a race and if you need to revisit

39
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,541
the course a second time

40
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,650
or revisit some videos, it is okay.

41
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,330
Many students have to do it

42
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,550
before mastering all the concepts.

43
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,710
So why should I teach this course to you?

44
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,530
Well, I just passed the SAA-C03 exam

45
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,780
with the score of 96.1%.

46
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,050
That's even before following my new topics at the exam.

47
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,850
So hopefully I'm the right teacher for you.

48
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,700
I also hold nine other AWS certifications.

49
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,930
So, I've taught AWS to a few people now, already.

50
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,860
So, who am I?

51
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,530
Well for those who don't know me, my name is Stéphane Maarek

52
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,630
and I've been teaching AWS certifications

53
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,270
to hundreds of thousands of students around the world.

54
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,400
So, I used to work as an IT consultant

55
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,130
and as an AWS solutions architect, Developer and SysOps.

56
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,765
So I'm quite familiar with AWS

57
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:09,240
and I've also built websites, applications

58
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,730
and streaming platforms on the cloud.

59
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,320
I'm a veteran instructor on AWS.

60
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,600
I've teach about 10 certifications.

61
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,970
I teach about CloudFormation, Lambda, and EC2

62
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,030
and obviously solutions architect associate.

63
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,220
You can find me on various platforms on GitHub.

64
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,480
You can follow me on LinkedIn.

65
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,300
You can read about me on Medium and follow me on Twitter.

66
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,950
If you want to connect with me.

67
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,590
So very shortly, we'll have a lot more deep dive

68
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,580
onto what's AWS, but AWS stands for Amazon web services

69
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,380
and it is a cloud provider.

70
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,320
It provides you with servers and services that you can use

71
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,177
on demand and scale easily, which is a big, big difference

72
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:46,770
from what you used to do on premises in your data center

73
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,290
where you had to order your servers physically

74
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,210
and install them before being able to use them.

75
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,880
On the cloud, we can get them whenever we want so on demand

76
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,790
and we can have as many as we want so we can scale easily.

77
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,880
And thanks to AWS as it has been revolutionized.

78
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,130
And now today, AWS power some

79
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,540
of the biggest websites in the world.

80
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,860
So you will be surprised

81
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,940
not surprised about amazon.com obviously because well

82
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,380
AWS belongs to Amazon, but for Netflix

83
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,630
they actually don't own a single server.

84
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,240
They rent everything from AWS

85
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,270
which allows Netflix to run at scale.

86
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,370
So, what are we going to learn in this course? Well,

87
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,400
we're going to learn a lot of AWS services.

88
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,230
As you can see some of them are right here.

89
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,330
There's even more, but I didn't wanna show them.

90
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,010
So don't feel overwhelmed.

91
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,890
My goal is to teach, show to you one by one.

92
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,070
So I like to say that AWS is a spaghetti bowl

93
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,140
because all these services are linked

94
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,970
and interconnected with one another.

95
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,040
But with me we're going to entangle

96
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,450
this entire spaghetti bowl,

97
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,210
have a very good meal, and learn AWS together.

98
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,110
So I hope you're excited.

99
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,640
I'm definitely excited to teach this course

100
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,073
to you and I will see you in the next lecture.
