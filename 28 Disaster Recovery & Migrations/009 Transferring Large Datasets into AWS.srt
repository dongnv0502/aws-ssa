1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,950
So here is a quick summary lecture

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,260
to describe to you all the ways you can transfer

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,630
a large amount of data into AWS

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,330
and which one is going to be the most appropriate based

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,010
on the constraints you have.

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,060
So for example,

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,460
let's say we want to transfer 200 terabytes of data

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,630
into the cloud,

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,920
and what we have currently

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,430
is a 100 megabits per second internet connection.

11
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,470
So, option number one would be to use the internet,

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,303
the public internet,

13
00:00:23,303 --> 00:00:25,200
or establish a Site-to-Site VPN,

14
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,630
which also uses the public internet.

15
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,850
And the advantage of this is that it's immediate to set up.

16
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,470
We can leverage our connection right away.

17
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,570
If we do a quick computation,

18
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,420
what we get is that it will take 200 terabytes converted

19
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,490
into gigabytes and then megabytes,

20
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,140
then you have to convert this to megabits,

21
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,670
so times eight,

22
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,650
then you divide by the speed you have,

23
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,630
so 100 megabits per second,

24
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,720
and that gives you about 16 million seconds,

25
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,210
which is the equivalent of 185 days.

26
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,650
So, almost half a year

27
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,720
to transfer 200 terabytes of data

28
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,970
over 100 megabits internet connection,

29
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,410
so this can take a long time.

30
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,990
Obviously, based on the size you have of the data,

31
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,520
it could be appropriate or not.

32
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,353
And in this case,

33
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:05,220
I will never probably transfer 200 terabytes

34
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,410
over this internet connection speed.

35
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,930
If I want to transfer now over direct connect

36
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,860
and say we have provisioned a one gigabits per second line,

37
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,693
then the first thing

38
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:16,830
is that it's going to be a long, one-time setup.

39
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,960
So if I'd never had direct connect before,

40
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,220
it will take about a month

41
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,320
to get this connection established.

42
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,210
And then, once I have this connection,

43
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,050
it will take about,

44
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,180
if we do the exact same computation,

45
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,250
10 times faster than my first connection,

46
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,070
so it's gonna end up being 18.5 days.

47
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,100
So a lot quicker, but still quite long.

48
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,100
Now, if I use Snowball, how long do I need?

49
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,260
Well, first of all, I need to order my Snowballs,

50
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,180
and then it takes about one week all in all

51
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,340
from the Snowball to being delivered, to being loaded,

52
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,310
to being sent back to AWS and the data being transferred.

53
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,620
It'll take about one week for the end-to-end transfer

54
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,670
and on top of it,

55
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,260
if there was a database

56
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,790
that was being transferred through Snowball,

57
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,990
it could be combined with DMS

58
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,360
to transfer the rest of the data afterwards.

59
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,520
So finally, for ongoing replications,

60
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,470
so this is like for one-off transfers.

61
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,430
For ongoing replications,

62
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,190
we could use techniques such as Site-to-Site VPN,

63
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,125
again, because we'll have less data to transfer

64
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,460
on an ongoing basis,

65
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,039
or use direct connect, or use DMS,

66
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,770
or use a service like we just saw, like DataSync.

67
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,280
So, all these things would allow us to transfer the data

68
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,620
on an ongoing basis continuously or not

69
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,620
through some more reasonable internet lines,

70
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,410
such as a Site-to-Site VPN or direct connect, okay?

71
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,700
Snowball is going to be used more

72
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,070
for one-off large transfers.

73
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,200
And as you can see, Snowball in this case

74
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,970
is really, really helpful into speeding up

75
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,790
our first data transfer into AWS, okay?

76
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,100
So, this lecture is just about to make you realize

77
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,900
which use case is more appropriate

78
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,970
and what are the constraints of each use case.

79
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,080
And then in the exam,

80
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,130
you will be asked to figure out

81
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,130
what is the easiest, fastest, or most reliable way

82
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,840
to send data into AWS

83
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,090
if it's a small data or a large data set.

84
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,020
All right, that's it.

85
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,770
I will see you in the next lecture.
