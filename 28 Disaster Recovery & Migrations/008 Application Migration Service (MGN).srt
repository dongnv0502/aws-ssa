1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,710
So there are two use cases

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,610
when you move to the cloud.

3
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,200
For example, you wanna start fresh

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,360
and you wanna leverage the cloud directly.

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,880
In this case, you don't need to do a migration.

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,240
But if you have on-premises servers and data centers

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,370
and you want to migrate to the cloud,

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,130
then you need to plan your migration.

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,070
And a way to do this is to plan your migration

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,760
using the AWS Application Discovery Service.

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,880
So the idea is that you're going to scan your servers,

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,590
and going to gather information

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,590
about the server utilization data and dependency mapping

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,510
which are going to be important for your migrations

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,310
so we can understand how to migrate

16
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,930
and what to migrate first.

17
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,270
So there are two types of migration you can do.

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,600
One is called the Agentless Discovery using a Connector.

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,270
And this gives you information around your virtual machines,

20
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,310
your configuration, your performance history

21
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,370
such as a CPU, memory, and disk usage.

22
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,260
Or you can run an agent

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,747
to do an Application Discovery Agent,

24
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:56,970
and this gives you more updates

25
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,060
and more information from within your virtual machines.

26
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,610
For example, system configuration, performance,

27
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,830
processes are running, and the details

28
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,990
of all the network connections between your systems,

29
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,530
which is good to get your dependency mapping.

30
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,780
Now, all this results data can be viewed

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,020
within another service called the AWS Migration Hub.

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,640
So this Application Discovery Service

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,670
really helps you to map out what you need to move

34
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,010
and how they are interconnected.

35
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,900
But then you actually need to move.

36
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,660
And the simplest way to move from on-premises

37
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,010
to AWS is using the AWS Application Migration Service,

38
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,930
also called MGN.

39
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,240
So this used to be called CloudEndure Migration,

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,090
but now it's been replaced.

41
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,160
And the idea is that using

42
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,520
the AWS Application Migration Service, so MGN,

43
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,600
you can do rehosting, also called lift-and-shift solution,

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,720
in which you convert your physical, virtual,

45
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,720
or other service on the other clouds to run natively on AWS.

46
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,840
How does that work?

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,910
Well, say you have a corporate data center

48
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,720
with OS apps and databases, and they run on disks.

49
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,910
What's going to happen is that you're going to run

50
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,310
the Application Migration Service.

51
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,620
And then the replication agent

52
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,260
that you have to install on your data center

53
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,520
is going to perform a continuous replication of your disks

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,090
so that you have, for example, low-cost EC2 instances

55
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,720
and EBS volumes that get this replication of data.

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,810
Now, the day you're ready to perform a cut over,

57
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,900
you can actually move from staging to production,

58
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,380
and have a bigger EC2 instance of the size you want,

59
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,650
as well as EBS volumes that match the performance you need.

60
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,450
So the idea is that you replicate data,

61
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,250
and then at some point, you do a cut over.

62
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,100
And that is by far the simplest way of doing it.

63
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,250
So this supports a wide range of platforms,

64
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,350
operating systems, and databases.

65
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,330
And this gives you minimal downtime,

66
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,560
as well as reduced costs

67
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,140
because, well, you don't need to hire complex engineers

68
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,973
to do this.

69
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:59,243
This is done automatically by this service.

70
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:00,076
So that's it.

71
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:00,990
I hope you liked it.

72
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,940
And I will see you in the next lecture.
