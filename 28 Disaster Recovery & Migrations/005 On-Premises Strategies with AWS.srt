1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,870
Okay, so yet another theoretical lecture,

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,230
but I still want to mention it

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,700
because I think it's extremely important going to the exam.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,430
You need to know about the services

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,060
that AWS offers at a very, very high level,

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,490
but just hear about them once

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,309
to do on-premise strategy with cloud.

8
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,130
So we have the ability to download the Amazon Linux 2 AMI

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,330
as a virtual machine and that will be in the ISO format.

10
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,560
And you can load this ISO image

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,470
into the common software used to create VMs.

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,480
So that includes VMWare, KVM, Virtual Box,

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,740
which is Oracle VM or Microsoft Hyper-V.

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,620
And this would allow you

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,050
to run Amazon Linux 2 on your on-premise infrastructure

16
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,290
directly using that VM.

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,870
So that means that you can make it work

18
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,620
with some user data and so on.

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,220
So quite cool to think about.

20
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,220
Then we have a feature called VM import and export.

21
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,580
And what this allows you to do

22
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,830
is to migrate your existing VMs and applications

23
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,180
into EC2 directly using this feature.

24
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,450
And you can also create a, for example,

25
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,030
a disaster recovery repository strategy

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,860
if you had a lot of on-premise VMs,

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,430
but you want it to back them up into the cloud.

28
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,940
And because it's called imports and exports,

29
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,080
you can export back the VMs

30
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,570
from EC2 your on-premise environment

31
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,260
if you wanted to.

32
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,100
Now for AWS application discovery service,

33
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,304
well, this is a service

34
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:19,070
that allows you to gather information

35
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,890
about your on-premise servers and plan a migration.

36
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,980
This is very high level,

37
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,800
but it does give you some server utilization information

38
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,090
and dependency mappings.

39
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,640
And that could be quite helpful

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,330
when you want to do a massive migration

41
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,130
from on-premise to the cloud.

42
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,280
Finally, you can track all that migration

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,170
using the AWS Migration Hub.

44
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,400
Then we have AWS database migration service or DMS,

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,859
which allows you to replicate from on-premise to AWS,

46
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:44,692
AWS to AWS

47
00:01:44,692 --> 00:01:47,090
or AWS to on-premise for your database.

48
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,070
So this is quite nice because

49
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,150
if you had a MySQL or a Postgres database

50
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,070
running on-premise,

51
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,210
and you wanted to start moving your workload into AWS,

52
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,410
you could use DMS

53
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,220
to replicate that database in the meantime,

54
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,053
and when you're ready,

55
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:02,040
you can fully transition to using AWS only.

56
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,873
And the nice thing about it is

57
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,350
that they work with various database technologies

58
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,470
that includes Oracle, MySQL, DynamoDB, et cetera,

59
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,560
and allows you to do some really

60
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,780
fancy use cases for example,

61
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,173
migrate data from MySQL into DynamoDB.

62
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,837
And then finally you have

63
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:21,363
AWS Server Migration Service or SMS.

64
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,030
And this is for incremental replication

65
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,730
of on-premise live servers to AWS.

66
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,360
So you can replicate the volumes directly into AWS.

67
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,780
And this is used for more ongoing type of replication.

68
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,970
Incremental replication.

69
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,020
And this is the last one that I have in my mind

70
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,530
for on-premise migration to AWS.

71
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,157
So at a high level, you may be like,

72
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:43,920
"Oh, this is a lot of services."

73
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,700
Just remember the names at a high level.

74
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,330
So in the next two on on-premise as possible,

75
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,090
we can do VM import and export for on-premise and EC2,

76
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,760
we can have migration services

77
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,925
such as application Discovery Service,

78
00:02:56,925 --> 00:02:59,670
AWS Migration Hub, Database Migration Service

79
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,430
and Server Migration Service, DMS and SMS.

80
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,740
And just remember those at a high level.

81
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,573
That's it.

82
00:03:04,573 --> 00:03:06,500
Just so you can see if you see the name in the question,

83
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,510
then you're not taken by surprise.

84
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,800
You know that all these things

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,730
have to relate to on-premise.

86
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,580
Well, that's it for this short theory lecture,

87
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,330
I will see you in the next lecture.
