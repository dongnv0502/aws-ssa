1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,680
So now let's talk about VMware Cloud on AWS.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,210
So here's some context.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,180
When you have an on-premises data center,

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,700
sometimes you would use the VMware Cloud

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,860
to manage your own on-premise data center.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,560
So you have your vSphere-based environment

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,460
and your VMs all managed from VMware Cloud.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,610
And consumers who have their own data center with VMware,

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,400
they want to extend their data center capacity

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,370
to also leverage the cloud and in particular,

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,350
they want to leverage AWS.

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,260
But they want to keep on managing everything,

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,420
their own data center and the cloud,

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,060
using the VMware Cloud software.

15
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,300
So this is the idea behind VMware Cloud on AWS.

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,980
Thanks to it you can extend

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,900
your entire VMware Cloud infrastructure to also be on AWS

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,470
and run vSphere, vSAN, NSX, and so on,

19
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,310
which you don't have to know

20
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,520
but they are VMware sub-services.

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,680
So once you have this, what are the use cases?

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,060
Well, the first thing is that now you can

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,760
extend computing power from data center to the cloud

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,760
or storage from the data center to the cloud,

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,280
and therefore you can start migrating

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,060
your VMware-based workloads to AWS.

27
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,700
You can also run your production workloads

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,370
across multiple data centers, and you can choose between

29
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,610
private, public, or hybrid cloud environments.

30
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,520
And finally, it gives you a disaster recovery strategy

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,440
because now you can quickly go to the cloud

32
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,530
using the same suite of software that you know.

33
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,340
And because that now you are on the AWS cloud

34
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,430
you can actually access the different AWS services

35
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,010
and start leveraging them such as Amazon EC2,

36
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,990
Amazon FSx, S3, RDS,

37
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,690
Direct Connect, Redshift, and so on.

38
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,523
So that's it.

39
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:45,690
It's just a high level overview that you need to know.

40
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,690
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
