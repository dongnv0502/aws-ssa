1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,910
So now, let's talk about Amazon Pinpoint.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,220
And Amazon Pinpoint is scalable two ways,

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,940
so inbound and outbound marketing communication service.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,980
The idea is that you want to send email,

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,170
SMS, push notifications, voice,

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,840
and in-app messaging through Pinpoint.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,720
And one of the main use cases is SMS.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,880
So the customers will receive an SMS

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,980
that you send from Amazon Pinpoint.

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,870
And you have the ability to segment

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,370
and personalize the messages

12
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,140
with the right content to customers.

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,960
So you can create groups and segments and so on.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,250
You also have the possibility to,

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,110
of course, receive replies.

16
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,140
And this scales to billions of messages per day.

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,140
So the use cases for Pinpoint is to run campaigns

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,570
by sending marketing email in bulk,

19
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,330
or sending transactional SMS messages.

20
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,780
And should someone reply or should it be successful,

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,780
then all the events such as text success,

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,210
text delivered replies, and so on,

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,610
will be delivered to Amazon SNS,

24
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,040
Kinesis Data Firehose, and CloudWatch Logs.

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,110
So you can build any kind of automation

26
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,870
easily on top of Amazon Pinpoint.

27
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,920
And so you may be wondering,

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,660
well, what is the difference between Pinpoint

29
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,540
and Amazon SNS or Amazon SES?

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,150
Because there is obviously some overlap.

31
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,780
So the idea is that in SNS or SES,

32
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,960
you have to manage each message's audience,

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,850
content, and delivery schedule.

34
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,550
And this is the responsibility of your application.

35
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,870
And that may be a lot of work,

36
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,730
and that may be not very scalable.

37
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,550
So in Amazon Pinpoint, instead, you're going to create

38
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,340
message templates, delivery schedules,

39
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,280
highly targeted segments, and full campaigns.

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,220
And all of this is managed by the Pinpoint service.

41
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,080
So see Pinpoint as the next evolution of SNS and SES,

42
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,180
in case you wanna do full-blown

43
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,820
marketing communications service.

44
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,080
So that's it for this lecture.

45
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,080
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
