1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,830
So here is a quick lecture

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,520
on the service named AWS Cost Anomaly Detection.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,650
And the name is quite explicit this time.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,830
So this continuously monitors your cost and usage data,

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,760
and it will use machine learning to detect unusual spends.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,079
So it's going to learn from you.

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,050
It's going to learn your unique historical patterns,

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,170
and then it will detect one-time cost spikes

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,110
and/or continuous cost increases.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,550
And you don't have to define anything,

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,050
you don't have to define thresholds.

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,050
It just knows on its own what looks a little bit weird.

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,140
So it's going to monitor for your AWS services,

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,320
your member accounts, your cost allocation tags,

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,330
and your cost categories.

16
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,000
And it will send you an anomaly detection report

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,440
with the root cause analysis

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,140
of what is happening in your account.

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,950
You can get notified by either using individual alerts

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,820
or a daily or weekly summary that leverages SNS.

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,070
So to summarize, using machine learning,

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,260
you can have a look at your cost,

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,920
you can get alerted and quickly analyze the root cause,

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,240
all of using the AWS cost anomaly detection service.

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,110
Okay, that's it.

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,130
I hope you liked it,

27
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,203
and I will see you in the next lecture.
