1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,400
So, now let's talk about Amazon AppFlow.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,350
So, AppFlow is a fully managed integration service

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,280
that enables you to transfer data

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,270
between Software-as-a-Service applications and AWS.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,250
So, these integrations are quite difficult to write,

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,100
and with AppFlow they're very easy.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,120
So, sources of data could be for example,

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,370
Salesforce, SAP, Zendesk, Slack, ServiceNow

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,180
and Salesforce is something that can come up in the exam.

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,580
And the destinations you can send this data to

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,310
can be Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,310
or even non-AWS targets such as SnowFlake and Salesforce.

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,470
You can define the integration to run on a schedule

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,980
or in response to specific events or on demand.

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,760
You get, from within AppFlow,

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,390
data transformation capabilities

17
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,540
such as filtering and validation.

18
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,200
And the data is encrypted over the public internet

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,200
or you can transfer it privately using PrivateLink.

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,720
The idea is that with AppFlow,

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,310
you don't spend some time writing the integration,

22
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,800
you just leverage these APIs immediately

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,520
and you enjoy the data within your own accounts.

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,670
So, in the AppFlow interface, you will have a source

25
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,940
and you can select many different sources,

26
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,870
but some of the important ones you need to remember

27
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,510
are the ones I said from before, including Salesforce.

28
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,330
And then using AppFlow,

29
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,100
you can send this data into various destinations

30
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,360
as you can see, Redshift, S3, and so on.

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,500
So, that's it for AppFlow, just an introduction.

32
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,380
I hope you liked it.

33
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,143
And I will see in the next lecture.
