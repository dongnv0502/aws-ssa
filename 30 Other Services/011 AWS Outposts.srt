1
00:00:00,196 --> 00:00:02,190
Okay, so now let's talk about

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,260
an exciting development which is called AWS Outposts.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,700
What is hybrid cloud?

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,870
Businesses that keep an on-premise infrastructure

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,840
alongside a cloud infrastructure

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,963
are called hybrid cloud.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,130
And when we have that,

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,130
we have two ways of dealing with IT systems.

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,610
We have one for the cloud of AWS, for example

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,420
using the console of AWS, the CLI

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,000
and the APIs from AWS,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,840
but also we have another one

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,100
that is dedicated to on-premises infrastructure.

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,750
And so, that means two different types of skillsets,

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,830
two different types of API,

16
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,030
and that may be complicated.

17
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,270
So it was said, "Okay, we do recognize

18
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,730
that some companies will run a hybrid cloud

19
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,330
therefore, let's create Outpost."

20
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,150
And Outpost our server racks

21
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,610
that offer the same AWS infrastructure,

22
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,400
services, API and tools

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,060
to build your own application on-premises

24
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,540
just like in the cloud.

25
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,720
So what this means is that

26
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,680
they will come and set up

27
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,290
and manage Outpost racks which are servers

28
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,620
within your on premises infrastructure.

29
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,370
And then these servers come preloaded

30
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,340
with the (indistinct) services

31
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,710
but you can benefit them from on-premises.

32
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,150
So as we can see now on your corporate data center

33
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,170
you will have your Outpost racks directly set up by AWS.

34
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,370
And this allows you to extend

35
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,500
the (indistinct) services directly

36
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,390
onto your on-premises data centers

37
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,680
which is I think revolutionary.

38
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,020
But a difference between an EC2 instance

39
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,010
running on the cloud

40
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,570
and an EC2 instance running in your own data center

41
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,340
is that now you are responsible for their security,

42
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,180
the physical security of the rack itself

43
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,133
because that rack is within your own data center.

44
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,860
The benefits from using Outposts are many,

45
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,960
first of all, you get low latency access

46
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,590
to on-premise the system,

47
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,970
you get local data processing

48
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,410
so the data may actually never leave your on-premise system

49
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,810
and never go to the cloud,

50
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,390
data residency, so again, it lives

51
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,980
within your own data centers.

52
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,290
It's easy for example, to start the migration

53
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,420
from on-premise is to Outpost

54
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,229
and then when you're ready from Outpost to the cloud.

55
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,259
It's a fully managed service.

56
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,680
So AWS will manage the service for you.

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,480
And with Outpost for now,

58
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,630
you can launch a lot of services

59
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,700
such as Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, Amazon S3

60
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,700
Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS, Amazon RDS, and Amazon EMR.

61
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,190
So it's really a cool way to extend the cloud directly

62
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,450
onto your own our infrastructure on-premises system,

63
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,700
and this is revolutionary.

64
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,260
So this may come up in the exam.

65
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,093
I hope you liked it.

66
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:38,020
And I will see you in the next lecture.
