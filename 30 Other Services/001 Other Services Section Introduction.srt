Welcome to one of the final sections of this course this section is a little bit special because

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,420
I'm going to mention other technologies that may be coming up at the exam for one or two questions but there

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,640
are going to be very basic questions.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,280
So this lecture will not be a deep dive into all of these topics it's just going to be an overview of

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,080
a few services. Overall as exam evolves and changes

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,640
I will make sure to add the appropriate lectures in this section. But everything you need to know today is already

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,240
here.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,530
I guarantee you this.

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,990
So let's get started and learn about the few other services.
