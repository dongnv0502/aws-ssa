1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,390
So here is a quick lecture about Amazon SES,

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,120
also called Simple Email Service.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,440
So to fully managed service,

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,280
as the name indicates,

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,860
they will allow you to send email securely,

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,840
globally, and at scale.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,940
So the idea is that your application

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,540
will use the SES API or SMTP server

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,050
and Amazon SES will then send bulk emails to users.

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,600
So this allows for outbound and inbound emails

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,280
so you can receive replies,

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,960
and it gives you a reputation dashboard,

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,910
if your emails are open or not,

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,930
performance insights,

15
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,880
as well as anti-spam feedback,

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,430
so if people rates your emails as spam or not.

17
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,810
It provides email statistics

18
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,290
such as deliveries, bounces, feedback loop results,

19
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,300
and whether or not the email was open,

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,950
and it supports the standard security

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,690
for email sending of today,

22
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,053
so you have DKIM and you have SPF.

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,660
There is a flexible deployment

24
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,460
so you can use a shared IP,

25
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,570
a dedicated IP,

26
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,640
or your own customer-owned IP.

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,180
This is to send emails from a specific IP address,

28
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,900
and then the APIs are accessible from the console,

29
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,620
specific AWS APIs, or the SSTP protocol.

30
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,080
So the use cases for Amazon SES

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,580
will be transactional emails,

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,630
marketing email,

33
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,630
and bulk emails communications.

34
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,980
So that's it for this lecture.

35
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,850
I hope you liked it,

36
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,800
and I will see you in the next lecture.
