00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,410
Welcome to this section

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,440
on Deploying and Managing Infrastructure at Scale.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,970
In this section, we'll see different ways

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,550
to deploy your workloads onto AWS.

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,710
And the first technology I wanna talk about

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,210
is CloudFormation.

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,630
So CloudFormation is such an important technology in the AWS

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,100
because it is a declarative way

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,220
of outlining your AWS infrastructure, for any resources,

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,170
and most of them are supported.

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,760
So to give you a concrete example,

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,350
in CloudFormation, you would say,

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,940
I want a security group.

14
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,770
I want two EC2 instances

15
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,690
that will be using that security group.

16
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,640
I also want an S3 bucket,

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,850
and I want a load balancer in front of all these machines.

18
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,980
Then CloudFormation automatically creates

19
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,590
all these things for you, in the right order,

20
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,260
with the exact configuration that you specify.

21
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,410
So the benefits of using CloudFormation are multiple,

22
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,243
but the first one

23
00:00:47,243 --> 00:00:50,130
is that all your infrastructure is as code.

24
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:50,963
That means that

25
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:53,280
you will never, ever create resources manually

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,660
like we've done in this course,

27
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,310
which is excellent for control.

28
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,680
And that means that anytime you do changes

29
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,590
to how your AWS cloud is doing,

30
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,500
then it needs to be reviewed through code review,

31
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,470
which is a great way to operate in a cloud.

32
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,450
On top of things, there is a cost advantage

33
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,550
because each resource within the stack

34
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,310
is going to get a tag that is going to be similar

35
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,130
to all the other resources creating within the stack.

36
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,760
And you can also easily estimate the cost of your resources

37
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,500
using the CloudFormation templates.

38
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,630
And finally, thanks to CloudFormation,

39
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,340
you can have a saving strategy.

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,310
For example, you can say that in some environment

41
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,070
you could automate the deletion of all the templates

42
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,903
at 5:00 PM,

43
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:35,100
which will delete all the associated resources

44
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,150
with that template,

45
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,450
and then recreate it at 9:00 AM or 8:00 AM safely.

46
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,710
And so therefore, you have cost savings

47
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,360
because you don't have any resources

48
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,340
between 5:00 PM and 8:00 AM.

49
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,173
With CloudFormation,

50
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:47,790
it's super easy to create and delete resources,

51
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,670
which is one of the biggest cloud principle.

52
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,020
Then for productivity.

53
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,430
So as I said, you're able to destroy

54
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,740
and recreate infrastructure on the fly.

55
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,890
It's also generating diagrams for your templates

56
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,780
as we'll see very quickly.

57
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,370
And there's declarative programming,

58
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,570
so you don't need to figure out

59
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,060
if you need to create a DynamoDB table first,

60
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,669
or an EC2 instance, or all these things together.

61
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,680
The CloudFormation template is smart enough

62
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,840
to figure out how to do things.

63
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,070
Finally, with CloudFormation,

64
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,810
we don't reinvent the wheel.

65
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,940
So that means that we can leverage existing templates

66
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,780
on the web,

67
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,430
we can leverage documentation,

68
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,120
and CloudFormation supports almost all AWS resources.

69
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,860
That means that everything we'll see in this course

70
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,570
is supported by CloudFormation.

71
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,560
And in case it isn't,

72
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,870
you can use something called a custom resource

73
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,760
for resources that are not supported.

74
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,200
So CloudFormation really

75
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,430
is the base of infrastructure as code on AWS.

76
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,480
So as I said,

77
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,910
you can visualize a CloudFormation template

78
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,490
using the Infrastructure Composer service

79
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,990
and to (indistinct)

80
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,590
to visualize a WordPress CloudFormation stack.

81
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,760
And as you can see,

82
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,500
we can see all the resources

83
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,090
of our CloudFormation templates.

84
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,130
So we can see the ALB Listener,

85
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,630
the database security group,

86
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,740
the SQL database,

87
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,880
different security groups,

88
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,170
launch configuration,

89
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,360
application balancers, and so on.

90
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,440
But on top of it,

91
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,800
we can see the relations between all of these components

92
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,300
and how they're linked together,

93
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,650
which is very handy

94
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,590
when you want to understand your architecture diagrams.

95
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,360
So from an exam perspective,

96
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,100
CloudFormation is going to be used

97
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,590
when we have infrastructure as code,

98
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,350
when we need to repeat an architecture

99
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,990
in different environments, different regions,

100
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,450
or even different AWS accounts.

101
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,283
So that's it for me.

102
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:29,340
I will see you in the next lecture

103
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,913
for a short practice on CloudFormation.
