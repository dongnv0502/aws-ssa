1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,910
Now let's talk about Amazon QLDB,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,800
which stands for Quantum Ledger Database.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,730
So what is it?

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,070
A ledger is a book recording financial transactions

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,820
and so QLDB is going to be just to have a ledger

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,160
of financial transactions.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,120
It's a fully managed database, it's serverless,

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,240
highly available, and has replication of data

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,160
across three availability T zones.

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,090
And it's used to review history of all the changes

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,710
made to your application data over time,

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,890
that's why it's called a ledger.

13
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,170
So it's an immutable system as well,

14
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,823
that means that once you write something to the database,

15
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:35,400
it can not be removed or modified.

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,013
And there is also a way to have a cryptographic signature

17
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:42,180
to make sure that indeed nothing has been removed.

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,960
So how does it work?

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,480
Well, there is behind the scenes a journal,

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,150
and so a journal has a sequence of modifications.

21
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,820
And so anytime a modification is made,

22
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,030
there is a cryptographic hash that is computed

23
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,500
which guarantees that nothing has been deleted or modified

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,670
and so this can be verified by anyone using the database.

25
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,550
So this is extremely helpful for financial transactions

26
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,810
because you wanna make sure that

27
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,290
obviously no financial transaction

28
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,100
is disappearing from your database

29
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,770
which makes QLDB a great ledger database in the cloud.

30
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,400
So you get two to three times better performance

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,540
than common ledger blockchain frameworks

32
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,750
and also you can manipulate data using SQL.

33
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,940
Now, as you'll see in the next lecture

34
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,160
there's also another database technologies

35
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,540
called Amazon Managed Blockchain.

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,720
But the difference between QLDB and Managed Blockchain

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,146
is that with QLDB, there is no concept of decentralization.

38
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:37,280
That means that there's just a central database

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,280
owned by Amazon that allows you to write this journal.

40
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,113
Okay.

41
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:43,917
And this is in line with many financial regulation rules.

42
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:47,090
So the difference between QLDB and Managed Blockchain

43
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,420
is that QLDB has a central authority component

44
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,070
and it's a ledger, whereas managed blockchain

45
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,930
is going to have a de-centralization component as well.

46
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,763
Okay.

47
00:01:56,763 --> 00:01:58,942
So that's it, anytime you see financial transactions

48
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:01,610
and ledger, think QLDB.

49
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,360
I will see you in the next lecture.
