1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,000
So now let's talk about Amazon Keyspaces,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,800
and Keyspaces is a managed Apache Cassandra on AWS.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,060
So Cassandra is an open-source NoSQL distributed database,

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,260
and so, with Keyspaces,

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,730
you get Cassandra directly managed on the cloud by AWS.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,130
So it's going to be a serverless type of service,

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,020
it's scalable, it's highly available,

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,030
and fully managed by AWS,

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,970
and it will automatically scale tables up and down based

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,890
on the application's traffic.

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,800
The tables' data is going to be replicated three times

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,540
across multiple AZ,

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,180
and to perform your queries on top of Keyspaces,

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,140
you are going to use the Cassandra Query Language or CQL.

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,973
So thanks to this,

16
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:44,010
you're going to get single-digit millisecond latency

17
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,030
at any scale,

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,790
and you can do thousands of requests per second.

19
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,940
Two capacity modes to note, this is just like DynamoDB,

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,530
you have the on-demand mode

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,740
and then you have the provisioned mode with auto-scaling,

22
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,950
and these are the same things as DynamoDB really.

23
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,020
You get encryption features, backup,

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,570
Point-In-Time Recovery up to 35 days,

25
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,340
and so, the use cases is going to be

26
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,640
to store IoT device information, time-series data,

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,580
and generally, from an exam perspective,

28
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,680
anytime you see Apache Cassandra,

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,830
you just think about Amazon Keyspaces, and you're done.

30
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,870
Okay, that's it for this short lecture,

31
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,870
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
