1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,730
Now let's talk about DocumentDB.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,660
So the same way we had Aurora as the way for AWS

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,270
to implement a sort of big cloud native version

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,910
of PostgreSQL and MySQL,

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,200
we have DocumentDB, which is an Aurora version for MongoDB.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,520
So MongoDB, if you don't know,

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,650
that's the logo on the top right corner of your screen,

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,840
it is another no SQL database

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,280
and you need to remember this for the exam.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,770
So DocumentDB is a no SQL database

11
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,910
and it's based on top of the MongoDB technology.

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,500
So it's compatible with MongoDB.

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,500
So MongoDB is used to store query and index JSON data,

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,960
and you have the same similar deployment concept

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,190
as Aurora with DocumentDB.

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,260
So that means it's a fully managed database,

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,640
it's highly available.

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,820
Data is replicated across three availability zones

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,310
and DocumentDB storage automatically will grow

20
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,590
in increments of 10 gigabytes,

21
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,330
and DocumentDB has been engineered

22
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,770
so it can scale to workloads

23
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,560
with millions of requests per second.

24
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,520
So at the exam, if you see anything related to MongoDB,

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,280
think DocumentDB, or if you see anything related

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,280
to no SQL databases, think DocumentDB and also DynamoDB.

27
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,210
That's it for this lecture.

28
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,043
I hope you liked it,

29
00:01:13,043 --> 00:01:14,970
and I will see you in the next lecture.
