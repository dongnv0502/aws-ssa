1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,830
Let's do a summary of

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,590
what we learned in the Amazon RDS section.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,020
And if you need to go back into any of these points,

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,970
I suggest you go back to the old lectures.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,370
This is a summary to summarize what you should know

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,930
out of Amazon RDS.

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,050
So this is a managed PostgreSQL, MySQL

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,386
or Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, MariaDB,

9
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:23,400
or you have the custom version of RDS.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,233
In Amazon RDS,

11
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:27,090
you need to provision an RDS instance size,

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,550
as well as an EBS volume type and size.

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,290
So everything is provisioned,

14
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,930
although you have auto-scaling capability

15
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,450
for the storage layer.

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,580
Amazon RDS supports read replicas

17
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,440
to scale read capabilities.

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,800
So if you have applications that need to run analytics

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,990
against a production database, it is much better

20
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,610
to create a read replica.

21
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,410
And for high availability purposes,

22
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,040
you can use the Multi-AZ to have a standby database,

23
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,498
although that database is just here for

24
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:57,150
in case a disaster strikes.

25
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,350
You cannot use it

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,630
to perform queries against it.

27
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,500
Security for your RDS database is done through IAM,

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,790
so you can use, for example,

29
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,650
username and password to connect to your database,

30
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,780
but also you can use IAM authentication,

31
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,070
for some of them.

32
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,090
You have security groups

33
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,150
for network security on your Amazon RDS database,

34
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,220
KMS for at risk encryption,

35
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,600
and you can have intrinsic encryption using SSL and TLS.

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,550
Now, if you wanted to do backups,

37
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,860
you have the automated backup option,

38
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,830
which is up to 35 days, and if you use that,

39
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,440
you can do point in time restore to any point

40
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,360
of time in these 35 days,

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,670
and this will create a new database out of it,

42
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,120
or if you want to retain backups for longer term recovery,

43
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,810
then you would use a manual database snapshots.

44
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,640
There is a managed

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,900
and schedule maintenance,

46
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,970
which will bring downtime into your database.

47
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,820
So this is due to the fact that you have to provision it

48
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,260
and that you have to update.

49
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,890
I mean, AWS has to update at some point database engine

50
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,440
or the underlying EC2 instance

51
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,693
for patches of security and so on.

52
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,980
There is support for IAM authentication on RDS,

53
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,250
and you can enforce it through the RDS proxy,

54
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,650
and it has integration with Secrets Manager

55
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,780
to manage the database credentials.

56
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,770
If you wanted to have access to the underlying instance

57
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,790
and customize it, then you can reuse the RDS custom option

58
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,190
and this is available for the Oracle

59
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,580
and SQL Server type of databases.

60
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,070
So the use cases of Amazon RDS is

61
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,590
to store relational databases.

62
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,810
For example, using the RDBMS

63
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,500
or have an online transaction processing database, so OLTP.

64
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,710
If you wanted to perform SQL queries on top of it

65
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,330
and transactions.

66
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,680
Okay, so hopefully nothing is new for you here.

67
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,940
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
