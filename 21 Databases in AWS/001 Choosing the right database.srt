00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,820
Hello, and welcome to this section on databases.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,520
So I'm doing a quick intro because at the exam

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,200
you will have to choose the right database

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,980
for your workload, and there are a lot of managed databases

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,690
on AWS to choose from.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,420
So it's mainly based on the architecture

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,990
of the question is asking, and so, is it write-heavy,

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,570
is it read-heavy, is it balanced workload?

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,100
What does it need?

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,980
Is it going to change or fluctuate during the day?

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,680
How much data is going to be stored and for how long?

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,990
Will it grow? What's the average object size?

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,660
How often are there access and how are the text?

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,550
What about data durability?

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,650
What is the source or truth for your data?

16
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,450
Do you have any latency requirements?

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,820
Any concurrent user requirements?

18
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,840
What is the data model?

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,670
How are you going to query the data, joins?

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,950
Is it structured? Is it semi-structure?

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,920
Do you need a strong schema or do you need more flexibility?

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,270
Do you want to include reporting

23
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,650
on top of your database or not?

24
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,790
Do you want search?

25
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,150
Do you want a relational database or NoSQL?

26
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,770
Are there any license cost?

27
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,780
Do you wanna switch to Cloud Native databases

28
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,250
such as Aurora and so on.

29
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,470
So, of course, based on the question

30
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,340
you have a different answer,

31
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,670
but just to give you the kind of dimensions

32
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,610
and the kind of avenues the questions can be geared towards

33
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,650
for helping you choose the right database.

34
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,620
But don't worry, we will see all the different databases

35
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,393
in this section and summarize them.

36
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,050
So first we have the RDBMS databases.

37
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,420
That means you're using SQL

38
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,940
or you wanna do online transaction processing.

39
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,390
So you have RDS and Aurora, and these databases are great

40
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,040
if you wanna do joins.

41
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,600
Don't worry, by the way, we'll go into a deep dive

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,650
in all these databases

43
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,690
so you don't have to remember everything.

44
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,140
Then we have the category of the NoSQL databases.

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,040
So NoSQL is going to be more flexible, usually,

46
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,470
but you don't have joint capabilities

47
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,470
and you don't have the SQL query language in general.

48
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,180
Okay, there can be exceptions.

49
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,160
And again, they will be discussed one by one.

50
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,440
So we have DynamoDB, we have ElastiCache,

51
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,350
we have Neptune, DocumentDB and Keyspaces,

52
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,270
and there may be new names for you, but don't worry,

53
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,360
we will learn about them in this section.

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,240
Then we have object store, so this is a kind of database,

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,729
yes, Amazon is free to store big objects

56
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,630
or Glacier to store backups and archives.

57
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,070
Then we have data warehousing

58
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,920
for SQL doing analytics with SQL

59
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,110
or business intelligence, BI.

60
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,470
So we have Redshift which is OLAP type of database,

61
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,510
and Athena and EMR.

62
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,000
We have the search type of databases.

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,520
So we have the OpenSearch type of database

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,570
to include some free text and do unstructured searches

65
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,160
on your data.

66
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,650
Graph databases, so to display relationships

67
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,560
between your datasets, this is Amazon Neptune.

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,170
We have ledger databases to have a list

69
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,910
and a ledger of transactions,

70
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,140
so we have the Amazon QLDB, so Quantum Ledger Database.

71
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,000
We have the time series types of database

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,240
for Amazon Timestream, and that's it.

73
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,180
We may have more database types and more databases

74
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,700
that it will include in section if need be, okay?

75
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,220
So don't worry if some of these databases

76
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,350
are not discussed in this section,

77
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,170
they will be discussed at depth in the following section

78
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,810
which is the data and analytics section.

79
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,910
Okay. So that's it for an overview.

80
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,410
Don't worry, you don't have to remember anything

81
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,243
from what I said.

82
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:16,860
It's just to give you where we're coming from.

83
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,690
And I will see you in the next lectures

84
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,943
to start discussing the databases one by one.
