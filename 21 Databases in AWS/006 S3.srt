1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,530
So now let's do a summary

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,050
of Amazon S3 from a database perspective.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,870
So, S3 is a key value store for objects.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,390
And it's great when you want to store big objects,

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,060
it's not great to store many small objects.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,380
So Amazon S3 is serverless,

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,970
you have infinite scaling.

8
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,060
The maximum object size is five terabytes

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,250
and you can version objects over time.

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,690
You have different storage tiers,

11
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,510
so you have S3 Standard, Infrequent Access, Intelligent

12
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,530
and you have a Glacier,

13
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,930
and if you want to transition between the tiers

14
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,300
you can use lifecycle policies.

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,770
Some important features you need to know

16
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,090
about are versioning, encryption, replication,

17
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,700
multifactor authentication deletes, MFA deletes,

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,230
and access logs.

19
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,020
In terms of security, you have IAM security

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,700
but you can also have bucket policies

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,260
on top of your S3 buckets.

22
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,190
You have ACL, you have Access Points for Amazon S3.

23
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,460
Then you have S3 object Lambda to modify objects

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,580
before they are sent to the applications.

25
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,950
You have CORS, and you have the concept

26
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,030
of Object Lock or Vault Lock for Glacier, which you know-

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,099
which you need to know about in depth.

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,190
In terms of encryption mechanisms, we have different ones.

29
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,193
We have SSE-S3,

30
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:12,930
SSE-KMS where you can bring your own KMS key.

31
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,980
You have SSE-C, you can do client site encryption.

32
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,040
You have encryption TLS encryption in transit

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,470
and you can set a default encryption scheme

34
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,690
for your S3 buckets.

35
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,290
And if you wanted to operate on all the files in

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,260
Amazon S3 buckets at a time you can use S3 batch

37
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,960
to do batch operations, and this is very helpful,

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,290
for example, when you want to encrypt unencrypted objects

39
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,870
on an existing Amazon S3 buckets,

40
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,210
or when you want to copy existing files

41
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,620
from one bucket to another before enabling S3 replication.

42
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,900
And to create this list of files,

43
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,570
you can use S3 inventory, for example.

44
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,070
In terms of performance improvements

45
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,860
on Amazon S3, you can use multi-part upload

46
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,250
to upload files in, in a parallel way.

47
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,660
You can have S3 transfer

48
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,200
acceleration to transfer S3 files faster

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,900
from one region to another region

50
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,570
and S3 select to only retrieve the data you need

51
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,310
out of Amazon S3.

52
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,760
For automation, you can use S3 event notifications

53
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,677
that has interfaces with SNS, SQS, Lambda, and EventBridge.

54
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:21,540
And this allows you to, for example,

55
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,590
react to events where new objects are created

56
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,600
on your Amazon S3 buckets.

57
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,250
So the use cases for Amazon S3 are around static files.

58
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,540
It's going to be a key value store

59
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,450
for huge files or website hosting.

60
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,520
So hopefully I'm not teaching you anything new here,

61
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,260
and if you have any doubts on any

62
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,260
of these features, and they can all appear at the exam

63
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,320
then I would suggest you go back to the Amazon S3 section.

64
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,153
Okay.

65
00:02:47,153 --> 00:02:47,986
That's it.

66
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:48,819
I hope you liked it.

67
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:50,130
And I will see you in the next lecture.
