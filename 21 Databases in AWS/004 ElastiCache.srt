1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,140
So we've learned about

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,610
Amazon ElastiCache beforehand,

3
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,140
so let's just do a quick summary.

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,250
So ElastiCache is a managed Redis or Memcached for Amazon

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,500
so it's a similar offering as RDS,

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,720
but this time for caches technology.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,680
So what is a cache?

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,840
Well it's an in-memory data store

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,240
which gives you sub-millisecond latency

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,980
when you want to read data.

11
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,690
So for this, you must provision

12
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,600
an ElastiCache instance type for your cache,

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,550
and then you are good to go.

14
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,460
So if you are using Redis, you can have support

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,660
for Clustering, Multi AZ, and Read Replicas for sharding,

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,360
and you have security provision through IAM.

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,980
You can use security groups.

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,140
You have KMS at-rest encryption,

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,900
and for Redis you have Redis Authentication.

20
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,510
You have the same kind of features as RDS

21
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,630
for backups, snapshots, and point-in-time restore.

22
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,640
You have managed and scheduled maintenance.

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,350
And the most important thing

24
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,490
need to remember for the exam

25
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,790
is that if you decide to use Amazon ElastiCache

26
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,100
to perform some caching on top

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,080
or combine with an RDS database,

28
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,970
is that to use ElastiCache,

29
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,330
you need to modify your application code

30
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,650
to leverage ElastiCache.

31
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,610
And so if the exam is asking you for a caching solution

32
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,550
that does not require a code change,

33
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,230
then ElastiCache is not a good choice.

34
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,063
Okay?

35
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:18,540
So the use cases for ElastiCache

36
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,190
are going to be Key/Value store,

37
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,730
when you do frequent read-on-top of your database,

38
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,980
it's good to cache database queries.

39
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,670
Also, if you have session data that needs to be stored

40
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,280
for your users on your website,

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,860
ElastiCache is also a very good use case.

42
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,520
And just so you know, you cannot use SQL on ElastiCache.

43
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,990
Okay, that's it for this lecture.

44
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,890
I hope you liked it.

45
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,840
And I will see you in the next lecture.
