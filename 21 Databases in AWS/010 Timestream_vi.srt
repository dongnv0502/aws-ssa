1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,820
So now let's talk about Amazon Timestream

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,140
and the name indicates

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,630
that it's actually a time series database.

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,640
So it's fully managed, it's fast, it's scalable

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,320
and it's serverless.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,000
So what is a time series?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,240
Well, it's a bunch of points that have a time

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,079
included in them.

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,750
So for example, here's a graph by year.

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,340
So this is a time series.

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,440
Now with Timestream you can automatically

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,670
adjust the database up and down to scale capacity

13
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,150
and you can store and analyze trillions of events per day.

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,150
The idea is that if you have a time series database

15
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,600
it's going to be much faster and much cheaper

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,290
than using relational databases for time series data.

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,190
Hence the specificity of having a time series database.

18
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,420
You can do schedule queries.

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,940
You can have records with multiple measures

20
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,880
and there is full SQL compatibility.

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,490
The recent data will be kept in memory.

22
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,470
And then the historical data is kept

23
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,350
in a cost-optimized storage tier.

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,620
As well as, you have time series analytics function

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,349
to help you analyze your data and find patterns

26
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,940
in near real time.

27
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,850
This database just like every database on AWS

28
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,640
supports encryption in transit and at rest.

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,640
So the use cases for Timestream would be

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,350
to have an IoT application,

31
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,720
operational applications, real-time analytics

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,470
but everything related to a time series database.

33
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,500
Now in terms of architecture, Timestream is here

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,460
and it can receive data from AWS IoT, so internet of things.

35
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,250
Kinesis Data Streams through Lambda can receive data

36
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,083
as well.

37
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:36,150
Prometheus, Telegraf, there are integrations for that.

38
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,160
Kinesis Data Streams as well through

39
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,380
Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink

40
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,500
can receive data into Amazon Timestream

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,560
and Amazon MSK as well through the same process.

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,290
And in terms of what can connect to Timestream,

43
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,470
where we can build dashboards using Amazon QuickSight.

44
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,230
We can do machine learning using Amazon SageMaker.

45
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,900
We can do Grafana or because there is a standard

46
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,150
JDBC connection into your database,

47
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,580
any application that is compatible with JDBC

48
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,060
and SQL can leverage Amazon Timestream.

49
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,893
So that's it.

50
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,520
I think for the exam you just need to remember

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,080
what Timestream is at a high level

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,630
but I want to give you a bit more details as well.

53
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,010
So that's it for this lecture.

54
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,850
I hope you liked it

55
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,863
and I will see you in the next lecture.
