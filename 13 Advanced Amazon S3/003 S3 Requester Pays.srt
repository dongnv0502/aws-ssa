1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,830
So here is a feature that you may get tested on

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:03,663
at the exam.

3
00:00:03,663 --> 00:00:05,720
And this is called S3 Requester Pays.

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,520
And the name is quite obvious.

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,530
So, in general, from what we've seen,

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,550
the bucket owners will pay for all of the Amazon S3 storage

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,880
and also the data-transfer costs associated

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,780
with their buckets.

9
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,360
So let's take an example.

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,590
We have a set of buckets,

11
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,240
we're storing some objects in it,

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,790
and then a requester, so, a user will download a file

13
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,000
from our bucket.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,870
And then what happens is that

15
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,510
the networking cost is also being billed

16
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,520
to the owner of the bucket and the objects, okay?

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,430
But, in case you are having a lot of heavy files

18
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,610
and some of the customers want to download them,

19
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,960
maybe you want to enable Requester Pays buckets.

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,710
And in that case, the requester will pay

21
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,700
instead of the bucket owner

22
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,960
for the data download of the objects.

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,860
So let's take an example again.

24
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,360
The owner still will pay for the storage costs

25
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,320
of the objects within the bucket,

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,800
but now the requester will download the object

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,510
and the requester will be the one paying

28
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,650
for the networking costs associated with that download.

29
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,130
The idea is that this is very helpful if you want to

30
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,410
start sharing large data sets with other accounts.

31
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,870
And for it to do so,

32
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,050
the requester must not be anonymous, okay?

33
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,540
The requester must be authenticated

34
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,980
in AWS because when it is authenticated with AWS,

35
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,140
then AWS knows to bill the requester of that request

36
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,560
for that specific download of the object, okay?

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,910
So that's it, just a feature to remember.

38
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,380
It can come up in the exam in a scenario.

39
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,213
I hope you liked it,

40
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:38,130
and I will see you in the next lecture.
