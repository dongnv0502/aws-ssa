1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Next, we have S3 Storage Lens, which is a service

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,250
to help you understand, analyze, and optimize

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,490
storage across your entire AWS Organization.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,800
With this, you're going to discover anomalies,

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,660
identify cost efficiencies,

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,400
and you're going to apply protection

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,540
best practices across your entire AWS Organization.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,900
You're going to get 30-day usage and activity metrics.

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,540
You can aggregate the data at the organization

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,760
level or for specific accounts, regions,

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,560
buckets, or even prefixes.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,450
You can create your own dashboard or use

13
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,390
a default dashboard provided by the Storage Lens service.

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,340
And finally, all these metrics,

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,830
all these reports can be exported into an

16
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,890
S3 bucket in the CSV or Parquet format.

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,130
So to summarize, Storage Lens will take all

18
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,900
these things into account, organization,

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,060
accounts, region, buckets.

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,240
Then you aggregate all this data into a report,

21
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,100
which is going to help you with your analysis.

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,340
And then finally, this can be sent for summary insights,

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,830
data protection, cost efficiency, which allows you

24
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,040
to optimize your usage of Amazon S3.

25
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,220
So when you use the S3 Storage Lens service,

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,200
you have a default dashboard

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,360
and the dashboard gives you summarized insights

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,840
and trends for both the free and the advanced metrics.

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,290
This default dashboard will show data across multiple

30
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,900
regions and across multiple accounts.

31
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,910
So you don't have to do anything special just

32
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,470
to set up the filters.

33
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,630
It is pre-configured by Amazon S3.

34
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,760
You cannot delete the default dashboard,

35
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,010
but you can disable it, if you wanted to.

36
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,350
So in this UI right here, you would select

37
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,510
the region you want, the accounts you want,

38
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,570
the buckets you want, storage classes, and so on.

39
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,390
And this is a centralized configuration.

40
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,800
And then once you have that,

41
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,230
the dashboard right here gives you information

42
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,420
such as, for example, the total storage,

43
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,240
the objects count, the average object size,

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,580
the number of buckets you have, accounts,

45
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,120
and you can get detailed per accounts,

46
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,010
or per region.

47
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,630
So let's have a look at what kind

48
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,450
of metrics are available into Storage Lens,

49
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,940
because this will help you understand if Storage Lens

50
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,630
is a service you should be choosing for the exam.

51
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,014
So you have summary metrics which give you general

52
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:10,919
insights about your S3 storage.

53
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,650
For example, storage bytes to know the size

54
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,570
of your storage and object counts to know

55
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,610
how many objects you have in your storage.

56
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,890
So use cases for this is to identify, for example,

57
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,790
the fastest-growing or not used bucket and prefixes,

58
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,190
because if the storage bytes remains the same,

59
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,680
that means that no new objects have been added

60
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,720
or same for object counts.

61
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,030
Then you have cost optimization metrics

62
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,340
and they provide you insights to manage

63
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,920
and optimize your storage cost.

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,800
So they give you an information about the non-current

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,190
version storage bytes, meaning how many version objects

66
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,960
that are not current,

67
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,910
how much space they're actually taking,

68
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,210
or incomplete multi-part upload storage bytes.

69
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,380
You know, if for example,

70
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,420
you've had some incomplete uploads,

71
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,820
how much space they take

72
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,890
in your bucket and you can clean it.

73
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,870
So the use cases will be, for example,

74
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,470
to see which buckets have failed multi-part uploads,

75
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,600
or which objects could be transitioned

76
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,090
to lower-cost storage classes.

77
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,340
You have data protection metrics to provide insights

78
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,050
for data protection features.

79
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,750
So here we have versioning enabled bucket counts

80
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,120
to make sure that all your buckets have been

81
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,156
enabled with versioning and so on.

82
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:23,370
MFA, delete enabled bucket counts.

83
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,640
SSCKMS enable bucket counts, cross replication

84
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,530
region rules, counts, and so on.

85
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,080
So the use cases are, for example, to identify

86
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,050
the buckets which are not following your data

87
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,390
protection best practices.

88
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,430
You have access management metrics to provide

89
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,410
insights for S3 bucket ownership.

90
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,720
So here's the name of the metric

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,600
and the use cases will be to identify which object

92
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,510
ownership settings your buckets currently use.

93
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,250
You have event metrics to get insights

94
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,320
for S3 event notifications

95
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,080
and to know how many buckets have the S3 event

96
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,670
notifications configured.

97
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,780
You have performance metrics

98
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,230
to get insights into S3 transfer acceleration

99
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,180
and see how many buckets have

100
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,430
S3 transfer acceleration enabled.

101
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,380
And you have activity metrics such

102
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,530
as information about all requests, get requests,

103
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,350
put requests, the number of bytes downloaded and so on.

104
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,279
And finally, metrics around the HTTP status code

105
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,850
such as 200OK, 403 Forbidden, et cetera, et cetera,

106
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,920
to understand the type of usage

107
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,303
your buckets are getting.

108
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,150
Now, you have different kinds of metrics

109
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,950
in two Storage Lens, you have the free

110
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,840
and the paid metrics.

111
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,650
So the metrics selection can be done in the UI as well.

112
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,150
But just as a summary,

113
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,400
while the three metrics are automatically available

114
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,720
to all customers, and it contains around 28 usage metrics,

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,750
and the data is available for queries for 14 days,

116
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,510
whereas for advanced metrics and recommendations,

117
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,730
you get additional paid metrics and features

118
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,780
such as the activity, the advanced cost optimization,

119
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,480
the advanced data protection and status codes.

120
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,340
And then you get also these metrics being

121
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,720
published to CloudWatch.

122
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,810
So you can access them without any additional charges.

123
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,870
And then you can collect metrics at the prefix

124
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,570
level within your S3 buckets.

125
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,580
And finally, the data when you pay,

126
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,250
is available for 15 months.

127
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,783
So that's it for S3 Storage Lens.

128
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:17,670
It's a very helpful service.

129
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,050
You have to remember the difference

130
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,760
between free and paid.

131
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,010
You have to remember that the default dashboard

132
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,550
has data across multiple accounts and multiple regions.

133
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,020
And of course, the fact that Storage Lens

134
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,650
covers your object storage, the fact that you can

135
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,290
count how many objects are encrypted and so on.

136
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,970
So let's say for this lecture, I hope you liked it

137
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,133
and I will see you in the next lecture.
