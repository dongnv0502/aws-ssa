1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,910
Let's explore some advanced options

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,310
for CloudFront that can come up in the exam.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,890
So let's talk about pricing and price classes.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,200
So we know that CloudFront edge locations

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,940
are all around the world,

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,890
but because they're all around the world,

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,570
the cost of data out per edge location will vary,

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,220
and so, here is a table.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,053
So as you can see,

10
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:23,640
based on the continent or geographic region

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,920
that the edge location is in,

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,810
then you will have a different pricing.

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,030
So if you look at this table, you're going to see numbers,

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,390
but if you look at Mexico, United States, and Canada,

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,440
the first 10 terabytes

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,610
is going to cost $0.085 per gigabytes,

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,370
but if you have the same edge location as India,

18
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,370
it's going to be about twice the cost at $0.17 per gigabyte

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,300
of data transferred, and so on.

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,240
And the more data transferred out of CloudFront,

21
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,130
the lower the cost, so if you transfer

22
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,160
over five petabytes of data out of CloudFront,

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,690
you're only going to pay $0.02 out of the United States.

24
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,850
So, the idea is that from the left hand side

25
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,670
to the right hand side, you have a higher cost.

26
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,130
Which brings us to the price classes.

27
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,140
So you have a choice you can make,

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,460
and you can reduce the number

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,370
of edge locations around the world that is going to be used

30
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,110
for your CloudFront distribution

31
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,300
in order to do cost reduction.

32
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,520
And there are three price classes available,

33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,110
there is the Price Class All,

34
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,090
which is giving you all regions,

35
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,890
and obviously, the best performance,

36
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,480
but it's going to cost you a little bit more money

37
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,190
because as you can see for example

38
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,020
an edge location in India will cost more

39
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,150
than an edge location in the United States.

40
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,220
You can do the Price Class 200,

41
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,480
which gives you most regions,

42
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,510
but excludes the most expensive regions,

43
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:44,160
and Price Class 100 to only get the least expensive regions,

44
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,860
and this is summarized in this table.

45
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,750
Now, the table is not really fun to look at,

46
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,400
so I made a little diagram.

47
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,450
Here is the world,

48
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,910
and we have a lot of edge locations around the world.

49
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,480
Now, the Price Class 100 is going to give us the America,

50
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,460
the North America, and Europe,

51
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,880
then Price Class 200 is going to add some of these regions,

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,320
and Price Class All

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,410
is going to have the entire world available

54
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,259
for the edge locations.

55
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,330
So that's it for this lecture, I hope you liked it,

56
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,280
and I will see you in the next lecture.
