1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,280
So, let's go and practice using CloudFront

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,830
but first we have to create an S3 bucket

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,530
to hold our files for our distribution.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,550
So, let's create a bucket

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,853
and I'll call this one demo-cloudFront-stephane-V4,

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,379
and it will scroll down, leave everything

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,293
as the default and click on Create bucket.

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,230
Okay, so my bucket is now created

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,393
and I'm going to upload some files in it.

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,080
So, let me add files and I will choose my three files,

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,800
beach, coffee, and index.html.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,400
So, let's upload them and now they've been uploaded.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,860
So, if I go in my bucket, we can see all of them,

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,930
and as a reminder, if I go on index.html,

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,670
I have two ways of open it.

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,880
The first one is to use the object URL, but if I try it,

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,720
I get an access denied because my object is not public.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,150
And if I go and click on Open here,

19
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,250
this generates a pre-signed,

20
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,570
so let's allow pop-ups,

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,500
this generates a pre-signed URL for my S3 object,

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,000
which allows me to access the object,

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
so I see I love coffee and Hello World

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,000
but I still don't see the image

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,430
because the image itself is not public.

26
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,370
So, let's see how we can instead use CloudFront

27
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,973
to make these files accessible without making them public.

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,753
So, let's open up the CloudFront console,

29
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,620
and as you can see on the top right corner

30
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,930
it is a global service because, well,

31
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,300
CloudFront is a global distribution

32
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,010
so there's no region selection.

33
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,960
We next have to choose an origin domain.

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,480
So, as you can see, I get my Amazon S3 buckets,

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,340
or my elastic load balancer or whatever.

36
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,020
So, if I choose my buckets,

37
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,060
I could choose my demo CloudFront bucket,

38
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,560
clicking out on here.

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,530
But here you can enter really any domain name you want

40
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,740
including custom HTTP origins, this is fine.

41
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,090
So, then the origin access.

42
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,680
How do you access the identity?

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,500
Well, because this is Amazon S3, we have multiple ways,

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,300
we have public, which is that

45
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,800
the bucket itself must be public

46
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,510
but this is not the case for us.

47
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,450
Then, we have Origin access control, which is OAC.

48
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,580
That's the recommended way we'll be using it,

49
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,610
and here it was OAI, it was the previous way of doing it,

50
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,840
but now we're going to use the new way

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,180
called OAC, Origin access Control.

52
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,669
So, we need to create an origin access control.

53
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,330
So, to do so, let's click on Create control setting

54
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,650
and it just gives us a name for it.

55
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,710
So, this is good, and let's click on Create.

56
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,770
So, now this has been created and we will have

57
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,500
to update the S3 bucket policy.

58
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,400
So, that's so that CloudFront can access our S3 buckets

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,200
because if you go right now in here

60
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,950
and look at our bucket itself under Permissions,

61
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,620
and scroll down, the bucket policy is currently empty,

62
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,140
and so CloudFront will not be able to access it.

63
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,197
So, right now we'll leave it as is.

64
00:02:38,197 --> 00:02:41,940
I'm going to scroll down and skip many different settings.

65
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,030
For WAF, we're going to just disable

66
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,730
the security protections because we don't need them.

67
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,830
And lastly, the one thing we have to do

68
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,210
is the default root object is index.html.

69
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,170
Okay, so everything looks good.

70
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,793
Let's create our distribution,

71
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,990
and our distribution can take some time to be created.

72
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,980
As you can see here,

73
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,870
the S3 bucket policy needs to be updated.

74
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,900
So, I can click on copy policy here,

75
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,000
and there is a shortcut from here

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,360
to go straight to your bucket policy settings.

77
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,490
So, page, so here we go, we have it.

78
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,320
Now, let's click on Edit,

79
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,680
and we're going to paste the policy we just printed.

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,550
And by the way, if you somehow lose access to this policy,

81
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,400
you can go under Origins, then in here in Origins,

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,620
you click on Edits, you scroll down,

83
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,930
and here you will find the policy statement

84
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,870
to copy and paste here.

85
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,330
So, if you look at this bucket policy now,

86
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,440
we allow the platform service to do get object

87
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,600
on any file in our bucket,

88
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,910
as long as the platform distribution,

89
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,220
So this is a condition, is the one we created.

90
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,050
So, this basically allows our distribution

91
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,910
to access S3 buckets.

92
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,920
This is good, this was generated by AWS.

93
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,110
We don't to do anything besides this.

94
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,240
So, the permissions are now correct.

95
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,900
So, back in CloudFront, let's cancel this,

96
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,550
and we go to our distribution,

97
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,490
and we have to wait until it becomes deployed.

98
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,110
My CloudFront distribution is now ready,

99
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,390
so I'm going to copy the domain name, open a new tab.

100
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,740
And as you can see now I get

101
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,890
I love Coffee, Hello World, and my image.

102
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,800
So, you can go to /coffee.jpeg

103
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,279
and of course this will work, and you can go to /beach.jpeg,

104
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,540
and this will work as well.

105
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,380
But the cool thing about it

106
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,450
is that now if I refresh this page,

107
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,880
this is served actually from the platform cache,

108
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,360
and not from the S3 bucket itself because,

109
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,070
well, I requested the file once,

110
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,680
so now they are automatically sent by CloudFront,

111
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,080
as you can see, the loading is much quicker.

112
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,090
And again, if I go to index.html,

113
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,860
this is served from the cache.

114
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,390
So, this is the beauty of CloudFront.

115
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,560
Now, we've done one request

116
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,060
against Amazon S3 through CloudFront

117
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,150
and then the rest is cached on the distribution itself.

118
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,150
So, if I go back now to CloudFront, on the left hand side,

119
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,300
just to show you, you have the origin access,

120
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,180
and this is where you will find your origin access controls.

121
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,730
And we can see that this one was created,

122
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,140
and is active right now,

123
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,290
and is assigned to this distribution.

124
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,370
So, okay, that's it.

125
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,630
We've seen how CloudFront works.

126
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,580
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
