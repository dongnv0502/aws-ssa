00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,250
Okay, so in this lecture, we are going to talk about

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,019
a newer kind of service for AWS called

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,939
the AWS Global Accelerator.

4
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:06,790
But before we do so,

5
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,230
I want to introduce the problem to you

6
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,750
that we're trying to solve and how we're going to solve it.

7
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,180
So, say you have deployed and application,

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,290
and it's global and you've global users

9
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,190
who want to access it directly.

10
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,880
But our application is only deployed in one region.

11
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,740
So, for example here in India,

12
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,250
I have deployed a public application advancer.

13
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,020
But my users are all over the world.

14
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,900
They're in America, in Europe, in Australia.

15
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,710
And so as they access the application,

16
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,619
they want to go over the public internet.

17
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,520
And that can add a lot of latency

18
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,790
due to many hops through the routers. Okay?

19
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,510
So, I'm obviously overplaying this,

20
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,030
so you can see that in America,

21
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,270
there's five hops of routers or servers

22
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,020
before we get to the public ALB in India.

23
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,090
And that's because it goes over the public internet.

24
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,650
Same for Australia, many hops.

25
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,290
And same for Europe, many hops.

26
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,920
So you can see these hops I introduce a bit of risk

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,270
connection can get lost,

28
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,605
they also add a little bit of latency,

29
00:00:56,605 --> 00:00:58,610
and they're not as direct as possible

30
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,180
into our amazon infrastructure.

31
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,280
So what we want to do is to wish to go as fast as possible

32
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,770
through as soon as possible the AWS US network

33
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,480
to minimize latency. And so before we do so

34
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,630
and use the global accelerator for this,

35
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,320
I want to introduce to you another concept

36
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,250
which is Unicast and Anycast IP.

37
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,010
So first, Unicast IP is what we know.

38
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,050
One server holds one IP address.

39
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,250
So our clients when they talk to two server

40
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,210
one has starting IP address is the left hand side

41
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,190
number 12 and the other one is 98.

42
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,590
Then if you refer to the IP address that begin with 12

43
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,434
we will be sent to the server on the left hand side.

44
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:35,663
And for the other one if you use the other IP

45
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:38,050
then we will go to the server on the right hand side.

46
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,220
This we know it makes a lot sense.

47
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,070
But for Anycast IP, is a little different.

48
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,420
All servers will hold the same IP address

49
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,350
and the client will be routed to the nearest one.

50
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,470
So this is contra-intuitive but this is how it works.

51
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,540
So our client has two servers

52
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,440
and these two servers as you can see in the bottom,

53
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,160
they have the same IP.

54
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,319
But our client when it tries to connect to this Anycast IP

55
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,510
will be sent to the server that is the closest to itself.

56
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,350
And as surprising as this is, this is how it works.

57
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,890
So Global Accelerator uses that Anycast IP concept to work.

58
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,970
So how does it work?

59
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,520
We're able to leverage the AWS internal global network

60
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,380
to route to our application.

61
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,610
So we have the same idea,

62
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,270
we want to route to India

63
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,530
and we have users all around the globe.

64
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,510
And is going to happen is that instead of sending it

65
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,610
through the public internet in America,

66
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,560
it's going to come to the closest edge location.

67
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,680
And from edge location,

68
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,920
it's going to go all the way straight to our ALB

69
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,380
through the internal AWS network.

70
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,510
Same for Australia, so it goes to closest edge location

71
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,690
near to Australia

72
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,990
and then it goes over the private AWS network

73
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,000
to get to the ALB and same for Europe.

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,230
So the idea with this is that,

75
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,140
we're going to use an Anycast IP

76
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,042
and there's actually going to be two of those

77
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:54,270
that are going to be created for your application

78
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,450
and they're global.

79
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,670
And the Anycast IP will send the traffic directly

80
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,010
to the closest edge location of your users.

81
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,230
And this is the power of Anycast IP.

82
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,060
So the edge location will then send the traffic

83
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,052
to you application, (mumbles)

84
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,010
For example,

85
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,150
through the private AWS network which is much more stable,

86
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,410
has less latency and so on.

87
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,650
So the Global Accelerator is absolutely unique

88
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,960
because it really allows to give two static IP addresses

89
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,660
all around the globe for the users

90
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,750
for whatever application you may have.

91
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,860
And right now I'm showing one ALB in one region

92
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,180
but it could be global as well

93
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,400
it could be multiple ALBs in multiple regions.

94
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,020
So it's a game changer to me.

95
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,240
So, what does it work with?

96
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,200
It works with Elastic IP, EC2 instances,

97
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,480
Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer

98
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,360
and they can either be public or private.

99
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,480
There is consistent performance

100
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,070
because we go over the network

101
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,240
so we have intelligent routing

102
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,400
to the lowest latency edge location

103
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,060
and we'll have fast regional failover

104
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,490
in case anything goes wrong.

105
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,890
There's no issue with client cache

106
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,380
because the client doesn't cache anything

107
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,350
the IP, the two Anycast IP we're using don't change.

108
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,170
It's internal AWS network to go after the edge location

109
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,170
so it's perfect.

110
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,550
And then we have health checks.

111
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,680
So the Global Accelerator will perform a health check

112
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,640
on your application and then make sure

113
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,390
that the application is global

114
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,400
and if health check fails for one ALB and one region

115
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,240
then there is automated failover in less than one minute

116
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,710
to a healthy end port.

117
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,170
So this is really, really great.

118
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,040
And it's amazing for disaster recovery,

119
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,450
thanks, to the health checks.

120
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,640
Now for security,

121
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,829
it's appropriately secured

122
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,380
because we only have two external IP

123
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,170
that needs to be whitelisted by your clients.

124
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,600
And you get DDoS protection automatically

125
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,070
through the Global Accelerator,

126
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,948
thanks to something called

127
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:31,820
AWS Shield that we'll see in the security session.

128
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,653
So this is great.

129
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:34,150
So you're really asking me what is the difference

130
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,200
between Global Accelerator and CloudFront?

131
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,860
And hopefully you already see the difference,

132
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,440
otherwise I failed but I want to outline these differences

133
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,870
very, very clearly.

134
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,170
So, Global Accelerator and CloudFront

135
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,300
they both use the same global network

136
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,310
and they will both use edge locations all around the globe

137
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,350
that AWS has created.

138
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,220
They both integrate with Shield for DDoS protection

139
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,400
so they both receive the same thing

140
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,680
but now their difference.

141
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,080
CloudFront is going to improve the performance

142
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,150
for both cacheable content such as images and video,

143
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,090
and also dynamic content such as,

144
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,930
API acceleration and dynamic site delivery.

145
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,780
And the content is going to be served

146
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,660
from the edge locations.

147
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,270
So once in a while the edge locations

148
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,283
are going to fetch the content from the origin

149
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:18,030
but most of the time hopefully CloudFront

150
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,100
will deliver cache content from the edges.

151
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,220
So here the users are getting content from the edges.

152
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,750
Whereas, for Global Accelerator,

153
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,020
it improves the performance of the wide range of application

154
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,810
over TCP or UDP.

155
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,124
But the packets are being proxyeed from the edge locations

156
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:37,090
to the applications running in two one or more AWS regions.

157
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,010
So in that case, all the request still make it

158
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,120
to our application end.

159
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,610
There is no caching available.

160
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,470
So it's a really good fit if you have a non-HTTP uses cases,

161
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,100
such as gaming, IoT or Voice over IP

162
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,420
or it's also really good if you have and HTTP use case

163
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,800
that require a static IP addresses globally.

164
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,633
Okay?

165
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,520
Or in case you need to have deterministic

166
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,320
and fast regional failover.

167
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,300
So, Global Accelerator is a newer kind of service

168
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,100
and it will appear in your exam.

169
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,060
I hope you like this lecture.

170
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,313
I will see you in the next lecture for some hands on.
