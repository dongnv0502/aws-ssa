1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
Let's talk about these firewalls

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,470
around our EC2 instances.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,900
So we briefly configured one in the previous lecture,

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,430
but security groups, yet again,

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,600
are going to be fundamental into doing network security

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,640
in the AWS cloud.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,820
They will control how the traffic is allowed into

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,550
and out of your EC2 instances.

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,170
Security groups are going to be very easy.

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,820
They only contain allow rules.

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,030
So we can say what is allowed to go in and to go out.

12
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,190
And security groups can have rules that reference

13
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,210
either by IP addresses, so where your computer is from,

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,740
or by other security groups.

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,890
So as we'll see, security groups can reference each other.

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,900
So here, let's take an example.

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,290
We are on our computer, so we are on the public internet,

18
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,870
and we're trying to access our EC2 instance

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,490
from our computer.

20
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,620
We are going to create a security group

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,480
around our EC2 instance,

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,460
that is the firewall that is around it.

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,310
And then this security group is going to have rules.

24
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,960
And these rules are going to say

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,180
whether or not some inbound traffic,

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,680
so from the outside into the EC2 instance is allowed.

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,630
And also if the EC2 instance

28
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,490
can perform some outbound traffic,

29
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,630
so to talk from where it is into the internet.

30
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,130
Now let's do a deeper dive, right?

31
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,280
Security groups are a firewall on our EC2 instances,

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,600
and they're going to really get

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,190
and regulate access to ports.

34
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,370
They're going to see the authorized IP ranges.

35
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,030
Would it be on IPv4 or IPv6?

36
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,350
These are the two kinds of IP on the internet.

37
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,540
This is going to control the inbound network,

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,120
so from the outside to the instance,

39
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,870
and the outbound network from the instance to the outside.

40
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,390
And when we look at security group rules,

41
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,770
they will look just like this.

42
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,410
So there will be the type, the protocol,

43
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,510
so TCP, the port allowing it,

44
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,570
so where the traffic can go through on the instance,

45
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,870
and the source, which represents an IP address range.

46
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,960
And 0.0.0.0/0 means everything.

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,750
And this here means just one IP.

48
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,400
Now let's look at a diagram, right?

49
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,320
So we have our EC2 instance,

50
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,040
and it has one security group attached to it

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,570
that has inbound rules and outbound rules,

52
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,699
so I've separated them onto this diagram.

53
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,810
So our computer is going to be authorized on, say, port 22,

54
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,330
so the traffic can go through from our computer

55
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,130
to the EC2 instance.

56
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,310
But someone else's computer that's not using my IP address

57
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,140
because they don't live where I live,

58
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,650
then if they try to access our EC2 instance,

59
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,090
they will not get through it

60
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,460
because the firewall is going to block it,

61
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,010
and it will be a timeout.

62
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,100
Then for the outbound rules, by default,

63
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,680
our EC2 instance for any security group

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,400
is going to be by default allowing any traffic out of it.

65
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,690
So our EC2 instance,

66
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,110
if it tries to access a website and initiate a connection,

67
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,110
it is going to be allowed by the security group.

68
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,320
So this is the basics of how the firewall works.

69
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,160
Now, good to know,

70
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,990
what do you need to know with security groups?

71
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,150
Well, they can be attached to multiple instances, OK?

72
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,950
There's not a one-to-one relationship

73
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,320
between security group and instances,

74
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,880
and actually an instance

75
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,400
can have multiple security groups too.

76
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,600
Security groups are locked down

77
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,750
to your region/VPC combination, OK?

78
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,250
So if you switch to another region,

79
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,450
you have to create a new security group,

80
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,430
or if you create another VPC,

81
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,190
and we'll see what VPCs are in the later lecture,

82
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,770
well, you have to recreate the security groups.

83
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,780
The security groups live outside the EC2.

84
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,640
So as I said, if the traffic is blocked,

85
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,800
the EC2 instance won't even see it, OK?

86
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,290
It's not like an application running on EC2.

87
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,530
It's really a firewall outside your EC2 instance.

88
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,480
To be honest, and that's just an advice to you

89
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,130
from developer to developer,

90
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,590
but it's good to maintain one separate security group

91
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,120
just for SSH access.

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,400
Usually SSH access is the most complicated thing,

93
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,040
and you really want to make sure that one is done correctly.

94
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,260
So I usually separate my security group

95
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,540
for SSH access separately.

96
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,060
If your application is not accessible, so timeout,

97
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,740
so we saw this in the last lecture,

98
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,510
then it is a security group issue, OK?

99
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,280
So if you try to connect to any port

100
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,010
and your computer just hangs and waits and waits,

101
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,290
that's probably a security group issue.

102
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,500
But if you receive a connection refused error,

103
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,320
you actually get a response saying connection refused,

104
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,390
then the security group actually worked,

105
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,210
the traffic went through, and the application was errored

106
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,340
or it wasn't launched or something like this.

107
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,300
So this is what you would get

108
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,160
if you get a connection refused.

109
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,740
By default, all inbound traffic is blocked

110
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,220
and all outbound traffic is authorized, OK?

111
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,870
Now there is a small advanced feature

112
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,920
that I really, really like,

113
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,770
and I think it's perfect if you start using load balancers,

114
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,540
and we'll see this in the next lecture as well,

115
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,820
which is how to reference security groups

116
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,260
from other security groups.

117
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,970
So let me explain things.

118
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,610
So we have an EC2 instance, and it has a security group,

119
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,963
what I call group number one.

120
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:43,320
And the inbound rules is basically saying,

121
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,900
I'm authorizing security group number one inbound

122
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,790
and security group number two.

123
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,500
So why would we even do this?

124
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,050
Well, if we launch another EC2 instance

125
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,290
and it has security group two attached to it,

126
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,210
well, by using the security group run rule

127
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,020
that we just set up, we basically allow our EC2 instance

128
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,960
to go connect straight through on the port we decided

129
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,360
onto our first EC2 instance.

130
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,030
Similarly, if we have another EC2 instance

131
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,920
with a security group one attached,

132
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,560
well, we've also authorized this one to communicate

133
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,540
straight back to our instances.

134
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,420
And so regardless of the IP of our EC2 instances,

135
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,240
because they have the right security group attached to them,

136
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,190
they're able to communicate straight through

137
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,510
to other instances.

138
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,060
And that's awesome because it doesn't make you think

139
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,590
about IPs all the time.

140
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,060
And if you have another EC2 instance,

141
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,760
maybe with security group number three attached to it,

142
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,580
well, because group number three wasn't authorized

143
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,800
in the inbound rules of security group number one,

144
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,500
then it's being denied and things don't work.

145
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,420
So that's a bit of an advanced feature,

146
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,310
but we'll see it when we'll deal with load balancers

147
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,020
'cause it's quite a common pattern.

148
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,040
I just want you to know about it.

149
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,780
Again, just remember this diagram.

150
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,850
And by now you should be really, really good

151
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,100
at security groups and understand them correctly.

152
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,850
Now, going into the exam, what ports do you need to know?

153
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,360
Well, we need to know something called SSH or secure shell.

154
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,700
And we're going to see this in the very next lectures.

155
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,960
This is the port 22.

156
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,210
And this allows you to log into

157
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,060
an EC2 instance on Linux.

158
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,960
You have port 21 for FTP or file transfer protocol,

159
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,650
which is used to upload files into a file share.

160
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,800
And you have SFTP, which is also using port 22.

161
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,633
Why?

162
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:22,380
Well, because we're going to upload files,

163
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,030
but this time using SSH,

164
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,360
because it's going to be a secure file transfer protocol.

165
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,360
Then we have port 80 for HTTP.

166
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,250
And we've been using it in the previous lecture.

167
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,520
This is to access unsecured websites.

168
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,380
And you've seen this whenever you go on the internet

169
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,530
and you enter HTTP colon slash slash,

170
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,600
and then the address of the website.

171
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
And you've seen most likely a lot more like this.

172
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,050
You've seen HTTPS, which is to access secured websites,

173
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,850
which are the standard nowadays.

174
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,150
And for HTTPS, it is port 443.

175
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,410
Finally, the last port you need to remember is 3389

176
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,620
for RDP or the remote desktop protocol,

177
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,510
which is the port that's used

178
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,850
to log into a Windows instance.

179
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,240
