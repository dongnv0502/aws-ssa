1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,002
Okay.

2
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:01,835
So we are going to learn how

3
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,920
to SSH into our EC2 Instance using Windows.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,100
And for this, we used to say, what is SSH?

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,170
Well, SSH to me is one of the most important function,

6
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,130
especially when you deal with Amazon cloud.

7
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,388
It will basically allow you to control a machine remotely

8
00:00:16,388 --> 00:00:18,190
all using the command line.

9
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,023
Okay.

10
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:20,280
And so what does it look like?

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,210
Well, basically we have our EC2 machine,

12
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,900
and it's running Amazon Linux 2, and it has a public IP.

13
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,570
And I don't know if you remember,

14
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,640
but we had an SSH security group on it.

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,840
And basically we allowed SSH on port 22 to any IP,

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,950
which basically allows our Windows machine to connect

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,290
over the internet directly into the machine

18
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,330
and control it using the command line.

19
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,370
So we'll see how to do the requirements for parameterizing

20
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,730
basically our Windows.

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,660
And so we'll use PuTTY to do SSH.

22
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,730
So this is a free tool available online.

23
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,563
And as you can see,

24
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:55,200
it's a little bit tricky to use the first time,

25
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,210
but we'll get used to it,

26
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,940
and we'll learn how to SSH into Windows,

27
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,600
into Linux using PuTTY.

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,230
So let's get started.

29
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,063
Okay.

30
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:03,620
So we are going to SSH

31
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,070
into our EC2 Instance and I'm running on Windows.

32
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,360
And for this, I assume that you have Windows 7,

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,190
or Windows 8, or an older version Window.

34
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,340
If you have Windows 10,

35
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,100
there is an alternative in the next lecture, both work.

36
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,933
Okay.

37
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:17,580
So let's try for, even if you're on Windows 10

38
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,900
you can do this technique.

39
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,390
So for this, you would go and download PuTTY.

40
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,110
So PuTTY is a free SSH client for Windows.

41
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,900
So download PuTTY.

42
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,210
And then I will choose, for example,

43
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,993
the 64 bits installer, the first one.

44
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,433
Then I go ahead.

45
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:36,960
I perform the install of PuTTY.

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,740
So next, next, yes.

47
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,390
And yes, I want to install PuTTY.

48
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,173
Perfect.

49
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:44,740
So PuTTY is installed.

50
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,570
And I have to install PuTTY.

51
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,240
So, we have two things here on PuTTY.

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,310
We have the PuTTY app, as well as PuTTYgen.

53
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,460
So let's first open PuTTYgen.

54
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,670
And in case you did not download your file

55
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,350
in the PPK format, you can actually generate the PPK format

56
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,730
directly from here.

57
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,030
So let me show you how it's done.

58
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,759
So, I need to go ahead and load my file.

59
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,800
So I click on load, and then find where my file is.

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,490
So for me, it's on my desktop.

61
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,670
And you can see, I see nothing,

62
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,447
but if I go to the bottom right, and show all files

63
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:22,280
I will find my EC2 tutorial in the PEM format.

64
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,700
So I can select it.

65
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,300
It says, okay, you have successfully imported this.

66
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,000
And then you can save it as a private key.

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,388
So click on save private key.

68
00:02:32,388 --> 00:02:35,950
And said you wanna have a pathways, you say,

69
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,300
if you don't wanna have path, you say yes.

70
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,938
And then you save it on your desktop.

71
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:44,030
So EC2tutorial.PPK

72
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,660
Now your file is saved

73
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,067
and you have converted successfully

74
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,450
a PEM file into the PPK format.

75
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,610
If you have done this already, then you're good to go.

76
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,560
Next, we need to set up PuTTY

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,640
to access our EC2 Instance.

78
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,330
So, this time you open the PuTTY app,

79
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,810
and here we have to enter a host name

80
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,730
or an IP address of where we are trying to connect.

81
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,540
So this we know it's My First Instance.

82
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,410
You copy the public IPv4 address.

83
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,243
You paste it.

84
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,690
And it's SSH.

85
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,420
You're going to save this under EC2 Instance.

86
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,290
And then you click on save, but we're not done just yet.

87
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,123
Okay.

88
00:03:24,123 --> 00:03:26,730
We need to specify the key itself.

89
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,780
So let's specify the key in here.

90
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,173
So, you have it saved under EC2 Instance.

91
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,063
I double clicked.

92
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:36,380
So as you can see, I have to accept this.

93
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,960
So if we accept because we trust the host,

94
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,150
we say, yes, accept.

95
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,890
But we still have the login as prompt and it will not work.

96
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,050
So if I do, for example, EC2 user, it says okay,

97
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,510
I cannot authenticate right now.

98
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,223
So for this, we go back into PuTTY,

99
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:52,780
and we're going to fix things.

100
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,150
So click on EC2 Instance and load this profile.

101
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,810
The first thing I'm going to add is in the host name.

102
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,900
I have EC2 minus user at the IP.

103
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,710
So the IP is where we access our server,

104
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,510
and the EC2 user is a user already created for us

105
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,470
on Amazon Linux 2.

106
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,090
So I can click on save again.

107
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,070
So we're done in here.

108
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,230
This will be saved.

109
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,720
And then for the key, we need to go into the SSH.

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,920
You click the plus, you have the Auth,

111
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,170
you click the plus, excuse me, no need to click the plus.

112
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,870
So you just click on Auth,

113
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,170
and then you need to find a private key file

114
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,440
for authentication.

115
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,300
Click on browse, go to your desktop.

116
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,160
And then you find the EC2 tutorial, that PPK file,

117
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,020
you have just generated using Puttygen.

118
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,879
Or, if you had downloaded it already

119
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,550
from the AWS console, that works as well.

120
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,030
So this file is good.

121
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,220
Don't click on open just yet, go back to session,

122
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,840
and then click on save, to save this profile.

123
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,760
This way you don't have to redo all these steps

124
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,810
all at once, over again.

125
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,340
So click on open.

126
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,130
And now it says, okay, you're authenticating

127
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,100
using the EC2 user.

128
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,300
And we have this file we just opened.

129
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,620
And so now we are into our Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

130
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,620
So we have successfully performed the SSH using PuTTY.

131
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,453
Okay.

132
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:14,427
So if in the course I refer to SSH, just for you,

133
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:17,840
just that means you should PuTTY into the Instance,

134
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,200
at least once.

135
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,277
And now what I can do, who am I?

136
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,390
And you find that I am EC2 user.

137
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,950
Or ping google.com and start running some commands.

138
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,980
So to stop this,

139
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,550
just do control C, and it will stop the command.

140
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,530
And then if you want to just exit this,

141
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,160
you can just close this, exit this session,

142
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,440
and you're good to go.

143
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,530
And let's check if you go back into PuTTY.

144
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,773
So click back on PuTTY, and you load the EC2 Instance.

145
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:44,230
Hopefully all you're seeing there is save.

146
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,450
So as you can see, the top settings are saved,

147
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,370
and my SSH Auth also has saved.

148
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,864
And therefore, if I click on open, then yes,

149
00:05:51,864 --> 00:05:55,930
I have access directly into my EC2 Instance.

150
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,580
So we've successfully performed SSH

151
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,490
on this Windows 7 or Windows 8, through PuTTY.

152
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,690
And I will see you in the next lecture

153
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,090
in case you have Windows 10,

154
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,063
to show you how to SSH using Windows.
