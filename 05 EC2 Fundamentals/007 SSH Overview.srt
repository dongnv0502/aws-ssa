1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,270
You're getting to one of the trickier bits

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,030
of running in the Cloud, which is how do you connect

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,560
inside of your servers

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,430
to perform some maintenance or action.

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,970
So for this, for Linux servers,

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,020
we can use SSH to do a secure shell into our servers.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,310
So based on the operating system you have on your computer,

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,310
you have different ways of achieving it.

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,420
So I have separated Mac, Linux,

10
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,580
Windows before version 10 and Windows after version 10.

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,830
So the SSH is a command line interface utility

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,930
that can be used on Mac or Linux

13
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,940
as well as Windows over version 10.

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,890
Then if you have Windows less than version 10,

15
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,060
you can use something called putty.

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,660
Putty will exceed the exact same thing as SSH.

17
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,100
So when I say you should SSH, if you're on Windows,

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,060
you can use putty.

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,940
And putty is valid for any version of Windows.

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,090
They do the exact same thing, they allow you to

21
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,620
use the SSH protocol to connect into your EC2 instances.

22
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,730
And then finally, there's something new

23
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,840
called the EC2 Instance Connect,

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,680
which is going to use your web browser.

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,450
So not a terminal nut putty your web browser

26
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,100
to connect to your EC2 instance.

27
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,540
And I like it a lot because it is valid

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,070
for Mac, Linux, Windows, all versions.

29
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,320
The cool thing about EC2 Instance Connect is that it works,

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,887
but it only works for now with Amazon NX2

31
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:22,200
And this is why I've been using

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,210
Amazon NX2 in this tutorial.

33
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,290
So now what should you do?

34
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,840
If you are on Mac or Linux,

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,300
then please watch the SSH lecture on Mac/Linux.

36
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,470
If you're on Windows,

37
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,140
then you can either watch the Putty Lecture

38
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,000
or if you have Windows 10, then I have created an SSH

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,030
on Windows 10 lecture as well.

40
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,990
Regardless, I am going to personally use

41
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,710
in the future lectures, EC2 Instance Connect.

42
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,710
So if you wanna have a look and play with it,

43
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,100
I find it really simple.

44
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,340
You don't need to install anything

45
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,980
or use the command line interface

46
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,410
if you're not familiar with it.

47
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,110
So this could be very handy for all of you.

48
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,040
Nonetheless, SSH is in my experience

49
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,000
and I've taught hundreds of thousands of students

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,600
what caused the most troubles in this course.

51
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,689
So if you get a problem with SSH

52
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:09,070
we can re-watch the lecture, you may have missed something,

53
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,150
maybe a security group rule, maybe you command,

54
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,980
maybe a typo, I don't know you.

55
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,530
There's also a troubleshooting guide

56
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,660
that I've put together after these lectures so have a look.

57
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,200
I would recommend your try, EC2 Instance Connect

58
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,980
as well as sometimes fixes all problems.

59
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,220
And if none of these method works, sorry

60
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,270
if one method works, then you're good to go.

61
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,590
You don't need to have them all working.

62
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,950
If one works, you're good to go.

63
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,340
And if no method works, that's completely okay.

64
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,380
This course is just introductory

65
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,133
and he won't use SSH much and you'll be fine.

66
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:43,640
So that's it that just for the introduction.

67
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,610
Now find your right lecture and it will see you

68
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,610
in the next lecture.
