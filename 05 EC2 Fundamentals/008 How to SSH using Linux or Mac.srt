1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
All right.

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:03,750
So now we're going to add SSH into our EC2 Instance

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,030
using our Linux or our Mac computer.

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,860
And you may say, what the hell is SSH?

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,700
What are you talking about Stephane?

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,600
Well, SSH is one of the most important function

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,210
when you deal with Amazon Cloud.

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,350
It basically allows you

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,030
to control a remote machine or server,

10
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,810
all using your terminal or your command line.

11
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,860
So how does that look like with the diagram?

12
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,340
Well, we have our EC2 machine,

13
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,640
and we launched Amazon Linux 2 on it

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,960
and our machine has a public IP.

15
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,630
Now we want to access that machine.

16
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,260
And so for this, I don't know if you remember

17
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,950
but we have a security group

18
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,420
and on it we allowed the Port 22 of SSH.

19
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,980
So what's going to happen is at our computer,

20
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,140
so my laptop for you, for me, or whatever for you,

21
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,160
then we'll access over the web.

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,880
Through that Port 22,

23
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,140
it will access the EC2 machine.

24
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,580
Basically, our command line interface is going to be

25
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,660
just as if we were inside that machine.

26
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,610
So let's get started.

27
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,443
Okay.

28
00:00:58,443 --> 00:01:00,790
So we are going to SSH into our instance.

29
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,250
So remember that PEM file you've downloaded

30
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,360
called EC2 Tutorial.pem?

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,298
Please make sure to remove the space in it

32
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:11,460
if you have a space, even if you have a PPK file.

33
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,890
Please rename it and remove the space from it.

34
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,290
So EC2Tutorial.pem is removed for me.

35
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,860
And then, you go ahead and place it in a directory you like.

36
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,500
So for me, I took my file and I pasted it,

37
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,290
and I placed it in a folder called aws-course. Okay?

38
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,230
So this is the first step to making sure you are ready.

39
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,270
So next, what I'm going to do is that I am going to go

40
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,670
in my EC2 instance overview page

41
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,410
and find my first instance.

42
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,100
So here we have my first instance

43
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,580
and we're going to SSH into it.

44
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,350
So we're going to open a remote terminal into it.

45
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,360
And for this, I need to get the public IPv4 address,

46
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,260
so I can copy this, and I will use it later.

47
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,900
The other thing I need to do

48
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,920
is to look at the security of my instance.

49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,250
So again, if you did everything with me,

50
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,730
then your security groups have this rule in it

51
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,730
called Port 22 which is the SSH port

52
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,860
from anywhere by 0.0.0.0/0. Okay?

53
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,160
So if you have that rule, then you're good to go.

54
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,320
If not, please click on the security group

55
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,750
and add the missing rule.

56
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,290
Next, I need to try to do an SSH.

57
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,853
So first of all, ssh ec2-user@

58
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,930
and then the IP you have.

59
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,500
So the reason we do ssh ec2-user

60
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,240
is because the Amazon Linux 2 AMI

61
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,870
has one user already set up for us

62
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,670
and that user is named ec2-user.

63
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,700
Then we have at,

64
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,120
to say that we want to access that user

65
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,680
on the specific server.

66
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,890
And then, we have the IP right here.

67
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,050
This is the public IP of our EC2 instance.

68
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,883
So we try this.

69
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:55,180
So we do SSH and then we're going to get

70
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,300
a too many authentication failure.

71
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,110
So that means that we don't authenticate

72
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,070
into our EC2 instances.

73
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,220
Well, that makes sense

74
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,370
because we haven't specified the key

75
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,940
that we downloaded from before yet. Okay?

76
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,480
You may get another kind of error

77
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,370
but right now this is the one I get.

78
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,550
So for this,

79
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,070
we need to reference the file we just downloaded

80
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,610
called EC2Tutorial.pem into our command.

81
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,530
So make sure again, there is no space.

82
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,080
And then, you need to make sure your terminal

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,390
is exactly where your file is.

84
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,716
So if I do ls right here to list the files in my folder

85
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:30,360
and I'm sorry if this is too advanced for you

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,800
but I have to cover the grounds for everyone.

87
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,870
So if I do ls, as you see right now,

88
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,260
it says EC2Tutorial.pem

89
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,680
that's because I placed my command line

90
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,670
in the correct directory on my computer.

91
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,503
Okay.

92
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:46,360
So for this, if you were not in the correct directory,

93
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,740
for example if I was line level up, so I do cd ..,

94
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,430
which puts me one level up,

95
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,570
then I do ls.

96
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,890
Of course, I don't see my EC2Tutorial.pem.

97
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,190
Okay?

98
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,750
So to do so, what you can do is just check where you are.

99
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,380
So pwd is where you are.

100
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,610
So, I'm in user stephanemaarek

101
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,290
and I know that I placed my folder aws-course

102
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,450
within my home.

103
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,010
So right under user stephanemareek, there is aws-course.

104
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,440
So for this, then I know that I can do ls or ll

105
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,160
just to confirm that my folder exists.

106
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,030
As you can see right here is my aws-course folder,

107
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,500
so this is good.

108
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,287
So what I do is I will do cd and then aws-course

109
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,830
which now puts me in the directory of my aws-course.

110
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,610
So if I do pwd, I am in the correct directory.

111
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,990
And if I do ls, I can see my EC2Tutorial.pem file.

112
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,190
The reason we have to do this is that

113
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,630
because now in the next command.

114
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,697
So the SSH command,

115
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:55,697
you do ssh -i then you specify the EC2Tutorial.pem file

116
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,740
and that will not work

117
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,141
if you're not in the correct directory.

118
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:00,613
So please make sure to get there

119
00:05:00,613 --> 00:05:03,610
and if you're missing the bit of the Linux here,

120
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,420
please try to go online,

121
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,590
but I should be good with what I showed you.

122
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,710
And then, ec2-user@

123
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,630
and we reference the public IP of our instance.

124
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,260
So this one right here, we reference it.

125
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,510
Press enter,

126
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,490
and now we get another kind of error

127
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,240
which is saying that we have an unprotected key file

128
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,490
and we need to change the permissions for it.

129
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,730
So for that reason, we'll have to enter another command

130
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,822
and that command is chmod.

131
00:05:33,822 --> 00:05:38,260
So chmod 0400, and then we pass in the file itself

132
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,530
so EC2Tutorial.pem.

133
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,840
So I clear my screen

134
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,680
and then I'm going to try the exact same command as before.

135
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,030
So I press enter and I am logged into my machine.

136
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,660
So you may have seen a screen

137
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,800
where they prompt you for yes/no

138
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,562
to trust the instance as well,

139
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,620
just enter yes if you do get that screen.

140
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,453
So as you can see,

141
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:01,890
now I have done the SSH into my instance

142
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,598
and now it says ec2-use at this IP,

143
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,460
which means that now all the commands are issued

144
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,090
are going to be issued directly

145
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,450
from the Amazon Linux 2 AMI EC2 instance

146
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,450
that I've just launched from before.

147
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,570
So let's try a few commands.

148
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,180
For example, if you do whoami

149
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,600
then it says ec2-user

150
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,850
or I can ping google.com

151
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,530
and we see the google.com is responding to our pings.

152
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,676
So we can launch some commands directly

153
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,100
from the Amazon Linux 2 AMI,

154
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,660
and I did control C to stop that command,

155
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,130
Now to exit the instance itself, you can either type exit

156
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,250
and I think this should work,

157
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,129
or you do control G and then you will close the connection

158
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,960
into the EC2 instance.

159
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,850
And if you ever want to get back into it

160
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,420
remember this command,

161
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,300
ssh -I EC2Tutorial.pem

162
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,450
if you are in the correct directory.

163
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,820
Please make sure to do so.

164
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,640
As well as ec2-user@

165
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,120
and then the public IP of your instance.

166
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,870
Remember that if you stop and then start your instance

167
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,250
then the public IP can change.

168
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,750
So make sure to change that part as well.

169
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,583
All right.

170
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:02,416
So that's it for this lecture.

171
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,370
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
