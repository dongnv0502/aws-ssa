1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,983
So on Windows 10,

2
00:00:00,983 --> 00:00:02,590
we can use the SSH command,

3
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,900
so I opened Windows PowerShell

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,040
and I typed SSH and if you see this,

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,800
that means that it's available.

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,440
Otherwise, you can also use the command prompt

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,708
and do SSH and if you see this,

8
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:13,970
that means the command is available.

9
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,610
If you don't see the SSH command on your Windows,

10
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,490
that means that you don't have it and therefore,

11
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,160
you must use the patching method I

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,650
just showed in the previous lecture.

13
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,420
In my instance, I'm just going to use PowerShell

14
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,090
to do these exercises, okay?

15
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,690
So, next what I have to do

16
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,020
is to actually run this SSH command.

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,940
So the first thing I have to do is to be

18
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,140
in the directory of where my pem file is.

19
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,320
So right now, I'm in C:\users\stephanemaarek and I do ls,

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,300
and as you can see, well, I don't have my pem file

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,580
because it's under, for me, under desktop.

22
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,430
So I do cd.\Desktop to just change directory,

23
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,890
I clear my screen then I do ls again

24
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,850
and I can see my EC2Tutorial.pem file

25
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,770
which is the one I downloaded,

26
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,040
as well as the ppk file but this is not relevant,

27
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,130
if you don't have it, it is fine,

28
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,200
this is only if you want to use PuTTY.

29
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,210
The only file that is of relevance for us

30
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,910
is the EC2 tutorial.pem file.

31
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,950
Okay, so we need to make sure that

32
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,350
on the security group of course we have

33
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,770
the port 22 open for SSH, which we do

34
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,060
and next we need to enter our SSH command.

35
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,500
So for this, it is very similar

36
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,900
to the one we have on Mac, so we do SSH minus I

37
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,260
then you pass in the name of the tutorial file.

38
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,260
So I did to get this, I did EC2 and then I press tab

39
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,490
and I get auto suggested the EC2Tutorial.pem file.

40
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,540
I press tab again, I can switch between ppk and pem.

41
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,680
Okay so, by pressing tab, I get the autocomplete of this,

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,980
so I do SSH minus I or you can just type this,

43
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:54,990
EC2Tutorial.pem and then when to type EC2 minus user at

44
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,830
and at, well, the public IP of my EC2 instance

45
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,300
which is right here, so I copy and paste it.

46
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,300
So now this command is saying,

47
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,940
please enter this IP using this user,

48
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,419
the EC2 user which is the one we have

49
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:13,000
because we use Amazon next to using

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,913
this key right here, so let's press enter.

51
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,970
And it says, well, the authenticity

52
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,430
of the host cannot be trusted,

53
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,610
do you want to continue?

54
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,660
You say, yes and we are in the machine.

55
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,800
So sometimes you will get permission issues.

56
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,580
So sometimes the permissions will not be happy

57
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,580
and I will show you how to fix them.

58
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,480
So first let's exit this and clear the screen.

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,950
So in case you get a permission issue

60
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,400
when running this command,

61
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,190
what you have to do is to find your keys,

62
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,010
so for me, it's in my desktop.

63
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,630
You right click on your pem file,

64
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,720
you do properties, you go to the security tab

65
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,480
and this is where we're going to change permissions.

66
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,120
To do so, we're going to do advanced

67
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,790
and the first thing you need to make sure of

68
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,970
is that the owner of this file is yourself.

69
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,890
So it's working for me, but you can just click on change

70
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,550
and then for object types, you can find yourself,

71
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,480
locations make sure it's on your computer

72
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,630
and then type the object name.

73
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,930
So it would be for me, Stefan

74
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,420
but I'm already an owner so just type your name

75
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,120
and then you can be an owner of this file.

76
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,090
The owner is also indicated in here,

77
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,240
in your app permission entries.

78
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,120
The second thing you have to do

79
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,540
is just remove these entities,

80
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,140
so system and administrator don't need to have access to it

81
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,760
and we need to disable inheritance.

82
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,820
So first let's disable inheritance, for this,

83
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,410
we're going to remove all inherited permissions

84
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,010
from this object.

85
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,950
And then in here, I just select the principal

86
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,147
so myself, I just go enter Stephan Maarek.

87
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,440
So as we can see, I did Stephan Maarek in here,

88
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,150
check names and this entered my principal name

89
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,040
and we are going to give myself full control over this,

90
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,100
press okay.

91
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,690
So now the owner is myself and the principal

92
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,050
that owns that file is myself as well.

93
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,210
We do okay and okay,

94
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,860
so if I right click again on this file

95
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,670
and do properties under security now,

96
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,533
I only see myself, Stefan Maarek with full permission.

97
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,250
And then if you have that

98
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,950
and you do this command again

99
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,400
for sure you will not have any permission issues

100
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,410
and you will not be prompted with a yes,

101
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,330
no question ever again.

102
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,000
And if you wanted to, you could try this command,

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,240
so let's exit this and we can, for example,

104
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,570
open the command prompt, go to my desktop.

105
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,200
Again, if you don't go to desktop, it will not work

106
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,790
and then paste in this command and it will work,

107
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,600
as well you can do an SSH from the command prompt.

108
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,800
So we've successfully seen how to SSH

109
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,950
onto our EC2 instance directly from Windows to exit,

110
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,380
you can just type exit or do Control + D

111
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,740
and we're good to go.

112
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,410
And now we can get started with this course,

113
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,380
I hope you liked it.

114
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,330
And I will see you in the next lecture.
