1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,830
So I wanna talk about IPv4 charges in AWS.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,400
So since February 1st, 2024, there is now a charge

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,640
for all Public IPv4 created in your account

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,280
whether or not they are being used.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,260
And so you have a $0.005 per hour

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,260
of Public IPv4, which is about 3.6 dollars per month

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,050
whenever you have a Public IPv4 in your account.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,760
So you have a Public IPv4 for example,

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,800
when you create an EC2 instance.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,990
Now for the EC2 service,

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,470
for new accounts in AWS you have a free tier of 12 month,

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,590
and in the first 12 months of your account,

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,590
you will have 750 hours of Public IPv4 per month.

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,970
That means that when you go over,

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,774
you're going to pay, of course,

16
00:00:49,774 --> 00:00:52,380
and for any other service than EC2,

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,350
there is no free tier, and you're going to pay that charge.

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,460
So it's a bit annoying.

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,500
So let me just try to do a diagram to explain to you.

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,820
So when we create an EC2 instance, we try to connect to it,

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,800
and so we'll have a public IP.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,120
And so this is free until 750 hours per month of usage,

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,770
which is about a month.

24
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,750
If you create a second EC2 instance

25
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,440
and you also create a public IP for that EC2 instance,

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,200
then again this goes towards the 750 hours per month.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,660
So you can have three, four EC2 instances,

28
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,450
it doesn't matter, as long as together,

29
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,380
the public IP usage is less than 750 hours per month,

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,213
you're good to go.

31
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:31,830
But if you go over, and you have four Public IPv4

32
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,090
for example, at the same time,

33
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,280
then of course you're going to pay for all of them

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,200
after this free tier.

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,130
When we go later on and create load balancers, for example,

36
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,810
then you may have one Public IPv4 per AZ.

37
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,790
So if you launch a load balancer in three AZ,

38
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,460
you'll have three Public IPv4.

39
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,810
Here, there is no free tier,

40
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,480
and so you will have charges incurred

41
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,340
while using a load balancer.

42
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,710
So it's a good idea to, if you wanna create it,

43
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,774
know that you'll have charges,

44
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:02,310
and know that you won't delete it fast enough

45
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,200
after doing the hands-on.

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,210
For an Amazon RDS Database for example, again,

47
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,340
this is not the EC2 service.

48
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,810
So when you create a database

49
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,750
and you want to connect to it from your public computer,

50
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,240
you will create a public IPv4 address,

51
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,140
and there is no free tier,

52
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,880
so you will have charges around it.

53
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,900
So just be mindful that you will have charges

54
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,733
in this course.

55
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,090
I said you would not,

56
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,680
but this is unfortunately a big change,

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,940
and there's no way around it.

58
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,760
So if you want to use any other service than EC2

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,470
and connect to it publicly,

60
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,350
you will have IPv4 addresses,

61
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,610
and you will have charges for it.

62
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,720
So please make sure

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,270
to never leave things running for too long.

64
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,490
Now you may ask me, "What about IPv6?"

65
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,610
So yes, the whole idea behind these charges for AWS is

66
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,000
that they're trying to migrate everything to IPv6,

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,350
where it's a bit easier to have them at scale.

68
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,590
And so in this course, I would love to use IPv6,

69
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,190
but it turns out that many internet service providers

70
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,640
around the world do not support IPv6 yet.

71
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,010
And so this course will not work for some of you.

72
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,220
So usually, you can go to an address like this,

73
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,260
for example, test-ipv6.com

74
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,870
to see if IPv6 is working for you.

75
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,150
But unfortunately, because, I mean, I am fortunate

76
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,760
to have so many millions of students around the world,

77
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,350
but it won't work for all of you,

78
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,350
then I'm not going to change the course for that reason.

79
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,690
So if you use IPv6 in this course on your own

80
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,510
because you want to avoid this tiny charge,

81
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,040
then you're on your own.

82
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,840
But know that you'll have to create

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,190
your own security group rules.

84
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,590
You make sure you make your own networking decisions,

85
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,423
but it's possible.

86
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,280
And if you know about networking, you will figure this out.

87
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,880
But if you're new to cloud computing, AWS, IT,

88
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,730
or networking in general, then keep on going with IPv4

89
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,033
and be mindful that you will have charges for IPv4.

90
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,380
Now, if you have charges, you may want to troubleshoot them,

91
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,410
so you need to go to your bill to see your charges.

92
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,520
And then there's a service

93
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,640
called the AWS Public Insights service that can help you.

94
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,180
And there's also a nice article that I've linked right here

95
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,940
that is explaining how you can troubleshoot these charges

96
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,990
if you can't figure out

97
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,750
which service still has an IPv4 address in use

98
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,000
and how you're being charged.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,070
So just remember that if you have any cost,

100
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,540
you go under billing and cost management in your account,

101
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,572
and then you go under bills on the left hand side,

102
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,170
and you will have a bill summary.

103
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,510
And here you can see your charges by service

104
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,050
and understand what is costing you any kind of money

105
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,920
by just drilling down.

106
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,440
So here on the right hand side, you would have an amount,

107
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,390
and then you can expand everything

108
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,210
and see what the amount equates to.

109
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,820
So if you have IPv4 charges,

110
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,440
they will appear right here,

111
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,650
and it's important for you to understand them.

112
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,860
Also, if you want to see your IP addresses,

113
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,220
you type IPAM, I-P-A-M in here,

114
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,760
and you go to Amazon VPC IP Address Manager,

115
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,790
which is a feature in the VPC console.

116
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,500
And this is how you can monitor all your IP addresses

117
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,960
in your account and get some information.

118
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,560
So you can go clear and click on Public IP Insights.

119
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,440
And here, you need to create an IPAM,

120
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,380
and we're saying yes to everything.

121
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,360
We can use it in the free tier

122
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,360
just to get the Public IPv4 usage in your organization.

123
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,460
And then you would go ahead, select the regions you wanted.

124
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,590
So, you can add all the regions,

125
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,870
and then click on Create IPAM.

126
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,820
And this will give you some insights

127
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,650
into your public IPs being used.

128
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,790
This is within the free tier.

129
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,920
Again, we're here under the free tier.

130
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,810
And so under Public IP Insights,

131
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,380
you would get some information around your public IPs

132
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,050
once information has been gathered on it.

133
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,980
So that's it for this lecture.

134
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,120
I hope you liked it.

135
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,073
And I will see you in the next lecture.
