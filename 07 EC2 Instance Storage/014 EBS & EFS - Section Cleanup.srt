1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,340
Okay, so let's just clean up

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,610
this entire section.

3
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,070
So for this I'm gonna go to Action on my file system

4
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,100
and delete it, and for this I have to enter

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,590
the file system ID, so I'll just copy and paste this.

6
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,540
And so okay, we're gonna get rid of our file system.

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,530
Perfect!

8
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,087
Now into our EC2 instances, make sure to terminate

9
00:00:16,087 --> 00:00:20,320
any running EC2 instance, so that's good.

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,930
Then in terms of volumes, we're going to have to

11
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,130
clear up volumes as well, so any volumes that is available

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,360
you have to terminate it, so I'll right-click

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,870
and delete all these volumes.

14
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,910
Okay.

15
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,230
Now for snapshots, you've made a few snapshots,

16
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,800
so let's just go back and delete every snapshot you have.

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,020
Just so that you can get rid

18
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,570
and not pay for any storage for snapshots.

19
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,470
Okay.

20
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,230
And then finally, security groups.

21
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,020
If you want to, because it's going to get a lot of

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,340
security groups right here,

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,890
you can basically delete so many of these security groups

24
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,960
except the one for default, so just don't delete that one.

25
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,790
So you can go ahead and delete these security groups.

26
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,560
And they will only be deleted once you have, basically,

27
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,870
deleted all your EC2 instances associated with those.

28
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,120
So maybe these won't be deleted right away

29
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,740
but you can just keep on trying until it works.

30
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,620
So I'll delete this security group now.

31
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,530
Yes this one works.

32
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,690
I'll delete the load balancer for the security group.

33
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,860
Yes that worked, and this EC2 for EFS,

34
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,280
it's still used by my instances

35
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,009
so I have to wait for my instances

36
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,150
to be shutting down properly before I can go ahead

37
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,560
and delete that last security group.

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,250
So I'll have to wait a little bit, but that's it.

39
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,300
Once you've cleared up everything

40
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,300
you're ready to go for the next section.
