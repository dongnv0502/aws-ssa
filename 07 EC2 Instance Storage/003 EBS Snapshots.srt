1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,700
So now let's talk about EBS Snapshots.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,520
So, an EBS Snapshot is a backup

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,640
at any point in time of your EBS volume.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,460
And for this, it's not necessary to detach your EBS volume

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,000
from your EC2 instance but it's recommended.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,400
You can copy these EBS Snapshots

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,230
across different Availability Zones

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,720
or even across different Region.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,920
So, for example,

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,920
let's take EC2 instance that has an EBS volume in US-EAST-1A

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,340
and an EC2 instance in US-EAST-1B.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,180
So we can take a snapshot of the EBS volume.

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,740
Okay, and thanks for that snapshot

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,130
we can actually restore it in another AZ.

15
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,920
So this is how you would transfer an EBS volume

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,683
from one AZ to another.

17
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,350
Next, you need to know about a few EBS Snapshots feature.

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,870
So the first one is called the EBS Snapshot Archive.

19
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,120
It's the ability for you to move the snapshot

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,120
to an "archive tier" that is going to be up to 75% cheaper.

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,519
So, if you do move this snapshot to an "archive tier"

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,290
then it will take you from within 24 to 72 hours

23
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,820
for restoring the archive.

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,860
So it's not immediate.

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,680
The other thing is to have a Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots.

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,460
So in case you do delete your EBS Snapshots

27
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,040
instead of being permanently deleted

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,250
then instead they're going to land in Recycle Bin.

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,330
And so the idea with this

30
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,770
is that you can recover them from an accidental deletion.

31
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,920
And the retention for your Recycle Bin can be set

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,503
from anywhere between one day to one year.

33
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,600
The last feature you need to know about

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,590
for your EBS Snapshots is called the Fast Snapshot Restored.

35
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,900
So this forces a full initialization

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,590
of your snapshot to have no latency on the first use.

37
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,180
This is particularly helpful

38
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,610
if your snapshot is big, very big

39
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,370
and need to initialize an EBS volume

40
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,220
or needs to instance out of it very quickly,

41
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,660
but this feature costs a lot of money,

42
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,850
so be careful when using it.

43
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,860
Okay, that's it for this lecture.

44
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,880
I hope you liked it.

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,923
And I will see you in the next lecture.
