1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,070
So we have this two gigabyte,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,650
GP2 EBS Volume available to us,

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,689
and we can take a snapshot from it.

4
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,470
So if we do Actions, we can Create a snapshot.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,270
So we can add a Description, for example, DemoSnapshots,

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,800
and then click on Create snapshots.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,870
So then on the left hand side menu,

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,410
instead of Volumes, you can click on Snapshots.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,610
And Snapshots shows you a list

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,170
of all the snapshots you have.

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,270
And as you can see, we have one right here.

12
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,110
It is Completed.

13
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,210
It is 100% Available.

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,610
And we get some information around the snapshot itself.

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,820
For first of all, what we can do is that we can Copy

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,830
this snapshot into other region.

17
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,620
So if you right click and do Copy Snapshots,

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,570
then as you can see, you can copy the snapshot

19
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,540
into any destination region that you want.

20
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,520
And this can come in very handy,

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,050
in case you want for example,

22
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,970
to have a Disaster Recovery Strategy,

23
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,990
to make sure data is backed up in another region of AWS.

24
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,960
So I won't do that, I won't do so, but you get the idea.

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,870
Another thing I can do is take the Snapshot,

26
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,360
and I can recreate a Volume from it.

27
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,960
So Action, Create volume from snapshots.

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,410
And we choose a two gigabytes GP2 Volume.

29
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,360
And then the target AZ doesn't have to remain eu-west-1a,

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,180
it can be, for example, eu-west-1b.

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,400
And we can also encrypt these volumes if you wanted to

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,750
and add some Tags.

33
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,870
And so as we can see, when we click on Create volume,

34
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,210
what's going to happen is that if we go back

35
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,830
into our Volumes,

36
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,710
well, now we have two Volumes, as you can see.

37
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,640
And one of them,

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,690
this one was restored through a Snapshots, okay?

39
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,150
And it is an eu-west-1b.

40
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,680
So the idea is that thanks to Snapshots,

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,220
we can quote unquote copy EBS volumes

42
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,500
across different Availability Zones.

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,300
And that's very handy.

44
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,550
If we look again at Snapshots, we can have a look

45
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,280
at what's called the Recycle Bin.

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,590
So the Recycle Bin is a way for you to protect

47
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,500
your EBS Snapshots from accidental deletion,

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,220
as well as your Amazon Machine Images.

49
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,824
So we can Create a Retention Rule and name it

50
00:02:05,824 --> 00:02:07,324
DemoRetentionRule.

51
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,580
I will select EBS Snapshots.

52
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,160
I will Apply to all resources and retain them

53
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,900
during one day.

54
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,480
And for Rule Lock Setting, I will leave this unlocked,

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,820
so that I can delete this rule whenever I want to.

56
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,493
And then click on Create Retention Rule.

57
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,200
And now on the Resources, we can see if we have Resources

58
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,850
in the Recycle Bin.

59
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,170
So let's go back into our Snapshots in the EC2 Console.

60
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,550
So I'm going to go into EC2.

61
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,620
Here we go, Snapshots.

62
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,150
Little shortcuts.

63
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,030
And what I'm going to do is take the Snapshots,

64
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,320
and first, before I delete it,

65
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,610
I wanna show you the Storage Tiers.

66
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,700
So right now it is a Standard Storage Tier, okay?

67
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,530
But you can move the Storage Tier,

68
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,360
by Archiving a snapshots,

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,520
and so I need to move the Storage Tier

70
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,950
into another Pricing Level.

71
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,910
But if you want to restore it,

72
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,850
of course, you will have to wait 24 to 72 hours.

73
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,780
So just to show you.

74
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,910
But anyway, let's go ahead and delete the snapshot.

75
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,980
So we'll delete the Snapshots.

76
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,210
As you can see, it's gone.

77
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,270
And before, it used to completely delete the snapshots,

78
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,920
and you couldn't recover it, okay?

79
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,090
As you can see, it's gone.

80
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,460
But now thanks to the Recycle Bin,

81
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,103
well, if I refresh here my Resources,

82
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,510
I can now see that my Snapshot has appeared here.

83
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,660
And what I can do is click on it and Recover it.

84
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,200
Yes, Recover Resources, and voila, it's back

85
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,110
into my Snapshots on my EC2 console.

86
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,360
Okay, that was pretty awesome, right?

87
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,040
Okay, that's it for EBS Snapshots.

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,040
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
