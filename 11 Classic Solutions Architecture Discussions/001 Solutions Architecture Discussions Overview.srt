1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,469
So so far we've been learning

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,190
all about individual technologies,

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,020
but here we're going to learn

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,360
how they fit together.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,220
And so we're going to view solution architectures,

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,550
now this is to me the best part of this course

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,210
so really this is the part I'm most

8
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,710
proud of is, okay.

9
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,800
No one does that,

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,710
how do we look and how do we see

11
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,440
how these technologies all fit together,

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,280
all work together into

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,810
a solution architecture.

14
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,480
So you need to be 100 percent comfortable

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,990
with everything I'm going to explain

16
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,780
in this section going into the exam

17
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,840
because this is pure solution architecture.

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,320
So to discuss this we'll be discussing

19
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,120
particularly how you can think of solution

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,940
architecture overall, iteratively,

21
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,490
through simple case studies.

22
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,780
We'll see whatisthetime.com,

23
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,180
myclothes.com, mywordpress.com,

24
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,700
how to instantiate applications

25
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,520
quickly, and Beanstalk.

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,130
So overall it will be a natural

27
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,540
progression, it will be increasingly complex.

28
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,570
But hopefully it will give you some good perspective on

29
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,290
EC2 vs ELB,

30
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,193
vs ASG vs EBS,

31
00:01:04,193 --> 00:01:06,020
EFS, RDS, Elastic, H--

32
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,030
All these kind of things, Enroute

33
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,863
(mumbles)

34
00:01:07,863 --> 00:01:09,370
how all they fit together.

35
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,203
Okay that's it,

36
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,390
let's get started with solution architecture.
