1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,460
So a very quick lecture on

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,300
instantiating applications quickly.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,890
So in the Architecture discussions that we've had

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,310
we have never really talked about how do we install

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,770
and deploy this application onto or EC2 instances

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,500
to basically run or websites, and so when you launch

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,550
your full stack, It can take a lot of time

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,010
to install applications insert or recover data

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,500
configure everything and then launch the application.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,360
So how can we speak that up? So we can use the advantage

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,960
of the cloud to speed up.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,210
So let's have a look for EC2 instances

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,873
we can use what's called a golden AMI.

14
00:00:35,873 --> 00:00:39,570
A golden AMI means that you install your applications

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,510
you're OS dependencies etc, everything beforehand,

16
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,150
and then you create an AMI from it

17
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,490
and then for the future EC2 instances,

18
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,980
you just launch them directly from the disk golden AMI

19
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,130
and the reason we do this is

20
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,380
that we don't have to reinstall the applications

21
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,780
US dependencies etc. We could just launch with everything

22
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,220
already installed and ready to go,

23
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,090
and that's the fastest way we can start up our EC2 instance.

24
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,300
So golden AMI is very common pattern in the Cloud to have,

25
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,700
and also seen how to use user data so easy to use user data,

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,550
and that allows us to bootstrap or instance.

27
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,900
Bootstrapping means basically configuring the instance

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,350
when it first starts. And so bootstrapping can also be done

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,800
install application OS dependency's etc.

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,660
But this is going to be very slow and we

31
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,720
don't want each application to do each easy to do instance

32
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,650
to the exact same thing the other one did

33
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,940
if it can be repeated.

34
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,413
But for dynamic configuration for example maybe retrieving

35
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:40,740
the URL for our data base and the password etc. etc.

36
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,970
We can use bootstrapping using the EC2 user data

37
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,768
and so we can basically have a hybrid mix of a golden AMI.

38
00:01:47,768 --> 00:01:51,500
An easy to user data to make it work, and this is something

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,940
we'll see in a second using elastic Beanstalk.

40
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,180
Elastic Beanstalk use the same principle of the hybrid,

41
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,610
where we can reconfigure an AMI

42
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,300
and then we add on some user data.

43
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,470
OK so for RDS databases we can restore from the

44
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,870
snapshots and then the database will have the schemas

45
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,740
and the data ready. Which is much better

46
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,270
than may be running a big insert statement

47
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,320
they will take forever to start RDS databases.

48
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,390
That may be a way to go be quicker

49
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,330
when you want to retrieve data.

50
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,820
And EBS volumes we can restore from a Snapshot

51
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,500
so we don't have to have a disc that's empty

52
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,340
and not formatted, we can retreat from a snapshot

53
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,300
and the snapshot will already be formatted properly

54
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,810
and have the data we need.

55
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,040
So these are the things you need to understand as a

56
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,163
solutions architect when going to the exam.

57
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:38,320
You say, OK we just speed up EC2 instances starting.

58
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,504
a way to speed up EPS databases or EBS volumes

59
00:02:40,504 --> 00:02:43,630
and formatting in the other kind of stuff.

60
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,390
This is what you want to do using golden AMI user data.

61
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,820
Restart database snapshots and EBS snapshots.

62
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,960
So that's helpful, hope that makes sense for you

63
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,910
and I will see you in the next lecture.
