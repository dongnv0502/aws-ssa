1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,730
Now let's talk about Amazon QuickSight.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,150
So Amazon QuickSight is a serverless machine powered

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,160
business intelligence service,

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,500
and so when you hear business intelligence,

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,120
that means that you're going to create

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,744
interactive dashboards.

7
00:00:13,744 --> 00:00:15,450
So this is what QuickSight looks like,

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,040
you can create dashboards

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,540
and these dashboards are connected

10
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,490
to data sources that you own,

11
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,100
and therefore you can create these nice visuals.

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,290
So it's fast, it's automatically scalable,

13
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,610
you can embed it in website,

14
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,890
and you get a per-session pricing.

15
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,660
The use cases for QuickSight are going to be

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,990
around business analytics, building visualization,

17
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,570
performing ad-hoc analysis in the visual fashion,

18
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,760
to get business insights using data.

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,890
And so you can connect to many data sources

20
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,750
as we'll see in the next slide,

21
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,890
such as RDS, Aurora, Athena, Redshift, S3, and so on.

22
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,570
Now there is something called the SPICE engine,

23
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,130
you need to remember it,

24
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,590
it's an in-memory computation engine

25
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,950
and it only works if you actually import data

26
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,930
directly into Amazon QuickSight.

27
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,730
It doesn't work if Amazon QuickSight

28
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,760
is connected to another database.

29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,706
And finally,

30
00:01:03,706 --> 00:01:06,870
QuickSight has some very nice user level features,

31
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,920
and so it's possible

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,830
in the Enterprise edition of Amazon QuickSight

33
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,800
to set up column-level security, CLS,

34
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,190
to prevent some columns from being displayed for some users

35
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,950
if they don't have enough access rights.

36
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,440
So what does QuickSight integrate with?

37
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,920
Well, you can integrate it with many data sources from AWS,

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,860
for example, your RDS database, or Aurora,

39
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,590
or Redshift, which is a great data warehousing service,

40
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,010
or Athena to do ad-hoc queries on Amazon S3,

41
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,060
or Amazon S3 to actually import data, or OpenSearch,

42
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,980
or Timestream to visualize your time stream data

43
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:45,540
in an optimized fashion.

44
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,718
You can also integrate with third party data sources

45
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:52,230
that are software as a service and supported by QuickSight,

46
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,510
and the full list is on the QuickSight website,

47
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,960
but some of them include Salesforce, and also Jira.

48
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,230
You can also integrate with third party databases

49
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,960
such as Teradata, or for example,

50
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,547
an on-premises database that is using

51
00:02:05,547 --> 00:02:08,490
the JDBC protocol internally.

52
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,580
And as I said, you can import data sources

53
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,140
directly into QuickSight,

54
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,230
such as your Excel files, your CSV file,

55
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,230
JSON documents, TSV, or the EFS CLF format for log formats.

56
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,120
And if these data sources are imported

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,500
into Amazon QuickSight,

58
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,600
then you can leverage the SPICE engine

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,980
to perform in memory computation in a very, very fast way.

60
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,750
So that's for the integrations,

61
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,210
and you will very commonly see at the exam

62
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,770
using QuickSight with Athena

63
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,720
or QuickSight with Redshift,

64
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,840
but any of these is possible to be seen.

65
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,970
Now you have two things in QuickSight,

66
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,680
you have dashboards and analysis.

67
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,260
So in QuickSight, you actually have users,

68
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,120
which is available in the Standard version,

69
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,350
and groups of users,

70
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,438
only available in the Enterprise version,

71
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:56,340
and these users and groups,

72
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,920
they only exist within the QuickSight service,

73
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,280
so they're not equivalent to IAM users.

74
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,460
IAM users are only used for administration.

75
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,260
And so you define these users and these groups

76
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,910
from within QuickSight,

77
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,800
and then you create a dashboard.

78
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,951
And a dashboard is a read-only snapshot

79
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:15,270
of an analysis so they can share,

80
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,790
and it will preserve the configuration of the analysis,

81
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,830
so whatever filters, parameters,

82
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,640
controls, and sorting options you set on your analysis,

83
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,700
is going to be preserved and is going to be a dashboard.

84
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,130
And so an analysis is more complete,

85
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,030
but you can share either the analysis or the dashboard

86
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,280
with specific users or groups,

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,590
and to do so, you must first publish,

88
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,360
for example, your dashboards.

89
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,640
And then if users have access to the dashboards,

90
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,400
they can also see the underlying data.

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,270
So in QuickSight,

92
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,080
you would create you analysis or dashboards,

93
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,710
and then you would share it with specified users and groups.

94
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,020
And that's it, you know everything there is to know

95
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,520
about QuickSight for the exam.

96
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,480
I hope you liked it,

97
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,433
and I will see you in the next lecture.
