1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
Now let's talk about Amazon EMR.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,800
So EMR stands for Elastic MapReduce

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,640
and EMR helps you create Hadoop clusters

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,250
for doing big data on AWS.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,840
This allows you to analyze

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,157
and process vast amount of data.

7
00:00:15,157 --> 00:00:17,310
Anytime you would see anything related

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,730
to big data clusters with Hadoop clusters,

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,466
then think Amazon EMR.

10
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:24,750
These clusters have to be provisioned

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,380
and they can be made of hundreds of EC2 instances.

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,030
Why would you use EMR?

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,400
EMR comes bundled with a lot of tools

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,410
that big data specialist use.

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,690
For example, Apache Spark, or HBase,

16
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,125
or Presto, or Apache Flink.

17
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,160
They're very difficult to set up,

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,340
so Amazon EMR will take care of all the provisioning

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,190
and the configuration of these services for you.

20
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,040
You can also auto-scale your entire cluster

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,290
and it's integrated with spot instances

22
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,750
for you to benefit from price reductions.

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,610
So the use cases of Amazon EMR

24
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,740
from an exam perspective are going to be

25
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,180
around data processing,

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,340
doing machine learning, web indexing and big data

27
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,850
but all of them using big data related technologies

28
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,077
such as Hadoop, Spark, HBase Preso Flink, and so on.

29
00:01:10,077 --> 00:01:13,950
Amazon EMR is made of clusters of EC2 instances

30
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,390
and you have different kind of nodes.

31
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,650
You have the Master Node.

32
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,720
The Master Node manages the cluster,

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,700
it will coordinate and manage the health

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,960
of all your other nodes, and it must be long running.

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,440
Then you have the Core Node, they're here to run tasks

36
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,070
and also store data, and they must be long running as well.

37
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,780
Then you have this Task Node

38
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,000
which is there just to run tasks.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
Usually you can take spot instances for it

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,197
and using task node is optional.

41
00:01:41,197 --> 00:01:43,830
The purchasing options really depends.

42
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,650
If you have the on-demand EC2 instance type

43
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,060
then you're going to get reliable

44
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,800
predictable type of workloads

45
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,870
and then will never be terminated.

46
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,550
If you use reserved instances,

47
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,190
and remember it's minimum one year of usage,

48
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,770
then you're going to get big cost savings

49
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,000
and EMR will automatically

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,030
use your reserved instances if possible.

51
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,420
Therefore, good candidates for reserved instances

52
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,370
are going to be the Master Node

53
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,050
because it must be long running, and also the Core Nodes.

54
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,920
Regarding spot instances, because they can be terminated

55
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,258
they're less reliable but they're cheaper.

56
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:23,790
A good way for you to leverage spot instances

57
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,773
would be on Task Nodes.

58
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,680
Finally, for EMR, in terms of deployment

59
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,780
you can have either long running clusters

60
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,290
which would make sense than using reserved instances,

61
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,840
or you can use transient temporary clusters to

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,060
just do something and then tear it down

63
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,768
once the analysis is done.

64
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,720
Okay, you know all you need to know

65
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,430
for Amazon EMR, the exam.

66
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,430
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
