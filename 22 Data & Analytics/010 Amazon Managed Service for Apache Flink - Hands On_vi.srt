1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,940
So here I am in the Amazon Kinesis service.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,770
And I wanna show you just the options

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,320
for Kinesis data analytics.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,340
So here it is.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,170
So we have two different kinds of things.

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,450
You can either create a streaming application

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,550
or go into the studio.

8
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,400
The streaming application is actually just

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,500
all leveraging app Apache Flink.

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,540
This is the case analytics for Apache Flink.

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,160
You choose a runtime version

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,380
for Apache Flink that's supported

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,050
and then you can have the application name.

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,130
And then, at some point,

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,530
you need to enter your production information.

16
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,260
And this would create a streaming application

17
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,910
that you can use on AWS.

18
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,520
And so you would need to actually upload then

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,993
your application here.

20
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,000
As we see when we get there

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,610
and we don't have any Apache Flink application available

22
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,590
to us, because this is quite complex, right?

23
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,290
Then you can run and you can even monitor it

24
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,330
using the Apache Flink dashboard.

25
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,210
So this service is to create Apache Flink applications.

26
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,880
And actually, if you wanted to just do one of analysis

27
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,010
you can open a studio notebook

28
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,050
and this will just quickly create a notebook

29
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,600
where you can start running your streaming applications

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,940
again, leveraging Apache Flink.

31
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay. So this I will not do.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,760
And then where is the Apache,

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,380
where is the Amazon Kinesis data analytics

34
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,550
for SQL applications?

35
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,200
Well, it's on the left hand side

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,340
and this is where it would be.

37
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,330
So you would find it under the SQL applications legacy

38
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,820
and now they recommend that you use all the time

39
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,270
Kinesis data analytics studio and Apache Flink?

40
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,310
But if you wanted to, for example, read from

41
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,860
Kinesis Data Firehose, you would create a SQL applications

42
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,680
in the legacy form and you would enter actually

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,410
the application name and it did create one.

44
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,920
And then once you've define your application name,

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,890
you can actually go to realtime analytics

46
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,710
and write the kind of SQL you want to do

47
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,810
for this application, okay?

48
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,890
So it's just an overview.

49
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,120
You don't need to know anything

50
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,580
about Kinesis data analytics for this exam

51
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,720
but I wanna show you the options,

52
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,130
give you a quick introduction.

53
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,370
And so you could visualize it as well on the console.

54
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,660
So that's it for this lecture.

55
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,680
I hope you liked it.

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,630
And I will see you in the next lecture.
