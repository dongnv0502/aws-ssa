1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,343
Now let's talk

2
00:00:01,343 --> 00:00:04,410
about the Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,780
It used to be called Kinesis Data Analytics

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,360
for Apache Flink, but since then it has been renamed

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,330
to just Managed Service for Apache Flink.

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,920
So Flink, what is Flink?

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, it's a framework, and usually use the Java, SQL,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,530
or Scala languages.

9
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,100
So it's a framework used for processing data streams

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,120
in real time.

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,850
So you have Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink

12
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,080
on the right hand side,

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,500
and then you can read data from Kinesis Data Streams,

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,950
or even Amazon MSK, which is Apache Kafka,

15
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,860
which is also a service for real-time data streams.

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,060
But it's not an AWS service, it's a managed service

17
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,310
for something called Apache Kafka.

18
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,870
All right, so you can,

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,510
thanks to the Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink,

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,240
you can run any Apache Flink application

21
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,670
on the managed cluster on AWS.

22
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,100
That means that AWS is going to provision for you

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,390
the compute resources,

24
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,880
is going to give you access to parallel computation

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,560
and automatic scaling.

26
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,758
On top of it,

27
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:05,519
AWS is going to manage your application backups,

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,810
which are going to be implemented

29
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,550
as checkpoints and snapshots.

30
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,800
And then you can use any sort

31
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,350
of Apache Flink supported programming features

32
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,220
to transform your data.

33
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,780
So you're really free around the type

34
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,330
of transformations you want to do on your streams.

35
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,720
And as you should know, Flink can read from, yes,

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,553
Kinesis Data Streams,

37
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:25,290
but it cannot read from Amazon Data Firehose,

38
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,450
and that could be an exam trick.

39
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,160
All right, so that's all you should know

40
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,590
for Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink.

41
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,330
Remember, it's only used for processing data streams.

42
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,860
And that's it for this lecture.

43
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,860
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
