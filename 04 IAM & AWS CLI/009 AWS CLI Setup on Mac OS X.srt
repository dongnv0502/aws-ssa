1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,093
So let's install the AWS CLI on mac

2
00:00:03,093 --> 00:00:04,718
and for this we're just going to go on Google

3
00:00:04,718 --> 00:00:06,720
and make sure to choose a link

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,240
installing the AWS CLI version 2 on macOS.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,240
And then we're just going to follow the process,

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,950
so we'll scroll down

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,720
and see what they say.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,220
And here is how to install it.

9
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,040
So we can just download a pkg file

10
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,060
and this will be a graphical installer.

11
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,713
So you download the pkg file.

12
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:29,460
Then you click on continue, continue, continue

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,800
and you agree.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,857
Then you say, "Okay, install for all the users

15
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:34,180
"on this computer."

16
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,550
Click on continue

17
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,560
and then click on install,

18
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,000
and this goes ahead and installs the CLI on mac.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,050
So we wait for everything to be done,

20
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,690
the files are being written.

21
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,130
Okay, the installation is now successful

22
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,910
and we'll move the installer to trash.

23
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,400
And now to fill this out,

24
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,100
you open a terminal on mac.

25
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,654
So you just go ahead and type, for example, "terminal",

26
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,610
and this will give you a terminal app.

27
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,930
Mine is called iterm on mac,

28
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,170
which is a free terminal that you can use.

29
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,850
And then you just type aws -- version

30
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,010
and if everything is going well,

31
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,040
then it should give you back the version

32
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,260
of the AWS executable.

33
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,180
So let's wait for a little bit.

34
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,250
And we get the answer,

35
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,330
AWS CLI 2.0.10,

36
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,236
so that means that everything has been installed correctly.

37
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:21,810
So that's it for this lecture.

38
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,690
In case of issues,

39
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,010
please have a look at this guide.

40
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,610
It will have the answer for you.

41
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,530
And that's it for me.

42
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,280
I will see you in the next lecture.
