1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,110
So let's go ahead

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,670
and practice using the IAM service to create users in AWS.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,503
So in the search bar,

4
00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:09,937
I just type IAM and I go into the IAM console.

5
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:12,510
So upon arriving on the IAM Dashboard,

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,070
we have some security recommendations

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,710
that we can for now not care about.

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,330
And what I want to draw your attention to

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,238
is that on the left hand side, we go to users.

10
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:24,900
So this is where we're creating to create users for IAM,

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,643
but first, let's notice something.

12
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:29,790
If you go to the top right corner and click on Global,

13
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,814
you can see that the region selection is not active.

14
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:36,734
That means that IAM as an entire service is a global service

15
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:39,661
and therefore there is no region to be selected.

16
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:42,000
When you create a user in IAM,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,950
it will be available everywhere,

18
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,380
but some other consoles we'll see in this course

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,843
will be region-specific.

20
00:00:47,843 --> 00:00:49,581
So just something to notice.

21
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:53,101
Okay, so now we have users, and why do we create users?

22
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:54,540
Well, we create users,

23
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,360
because right now, we are using what's called the root user.

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,590
So if you click on this,

25
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,470
you see there's just the account ID available to you.

26
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,640
So when you have it,

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,870
that means you're using the root account

28
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,896
and it's not best practice to use the root account.

29
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:10,358
So therefore, we want to create users such as admin users

30
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:13,680
that will allow us to use our accounts more safely.

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,332
So for this, let's go ahead and create a user,

32
00:01:16,332 --> 00:01:20,096
and I will provide a username, for example, Stephane.

33
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:22,620
So of course I want to provide myself access

34
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,910
to the management console,

35
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,230
so I'm going to do this,

36
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,480
and we have the option to use identity center,

37
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,155
which is recommended,

38
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,120
or to create an IAM user.

39
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,655
I will choose the second option because it is more simple,

40
00:01:32,655 --> 00:01:34,920
and from an exam perspective,

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,510
this is the one you need to know about.

42
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,343
But don't worry,

43
00:01:37,343 --> 00:01:39,798
this does not affect how your course is going to go.

44
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:41,579
Okay, so we create an IAM user,

45
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,680
and now we have to set the password.

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,440
So if this was a user that was not me,

47
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,750
I would leave it as auto-generated password,

48
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,280
and I would leave this

49
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,350
so that the user must change this password

50
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,610
at the next sign-in,

51
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,840
but because it is me,

52
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,896
I'm just going to enter a custom password

53
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:59,280
and I'm going to untick this

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,630
because I don't need to change my password

55
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,130
at the next login.

56
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,318
So let's click on next.

57
00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:06,278
Next, we have to add permissions to this user,

58
00:02:06,278 --> 00:02:09,240
so we can add it directly or we can get started with groups.

59
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,330
So let's create a group, and we're going to create a group.

60
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,176
The group name is going to be admin

61
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:17,360
and the policy name is going to be administrator access.

62
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,680
So now that this is done,

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,539
we can add the user into the admin group.

64
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:23,898
So let's click on next,

65
00:02:23,898 --> 00:02:26,100
and we can review everything right now.

66
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,950
So we have the username, the permissions on the group,

67
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,980
and we have tags, and tags are everywhere in AWS.

68
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,736
They're optional, but they allow you to give metadata

69
00:02:34,736 --> 00:02:36,576
to many of your resources.

70
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:37,950
For example, I could say

71
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,770
that the department of Stephane is engineering.

72
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,210
This is not something I'm going to do everywhere

73
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,478
on the course,

74
00:02:43,478 --> 00:02:44,735
but I want show you once how

75
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:46,253
you can add tags to resources in AWS.

76
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:50,219
Okay, so now the user is created successfully.

77
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:53,730
So now we can email signing instructions or download

78
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,460
CSV files and then we can log in with this user.

79
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,582
But first, let's return to the user list

80
00:02:58,582 --> 00:03:00,577
and have a look at everything.

81
00:03:00,577 --> 00:03:03,877
So here is my user lists, here is me

82
00:03:03,877 --> 00:03:05,850
and we also have groups.

83
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,500
So if I go to the left hand side, user groups,

84
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,670
we have admins.

85
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,260
So let's observe admins.

86
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,140
So admins has one user in it named Stephane.

87
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,970
And if you look at permissions of admins

88
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,280
you see that there is administrator access attached

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,698
to the admin group.

90
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,382
Now if I go to my user, Stephane in here,

91
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:23,640
we can look at permission policies

92
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,904
and see it also has administrative access

93
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:28,544
but this one has not been attached directly.

94
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:31,500
It has been attached via the group admin.

95
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,304
So that means that Stephane inherited any permissions

96
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:36,117
of the group admin it is in.

97
00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:38,100
And this is why we put users in groups.

98
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,784
It is a bit more simple to manage permissions this way.

99
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:43,280
So now let's go back to our dashboard

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,184
and we want to sign in with our user, Stephane.

101
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:50,704
So first what we can do is look at our AWS accounts

102
00:03:50,704 --> 00:03:54,177
and it has an account ID and a Sign-in URL.

103
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:57,104
Now you can customize this Sign-in URL very easily

104
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,403
by creating what's called an account alias.

105
00:03:59,403 --> 00:04:04,403
So it could be aws-stephane-v3 and then Create alias

106
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:07,830
so whatever alias until someone hasn't created it,

107
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,910
so it has to be unique.

108
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,100
For example, v5 is available.

109
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,100
So now using this alias can simplify my signing URL.

110
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,390
Now to sign in using my Stephane accounts

111
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,980
we could use the same browser

112
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,254
or we could create a new browser window in private mode.

113
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:24,990
And the benefit of doing this is

114
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,859
that we can have two windows side by side using AWS.

115
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:31,980
So if you don't do this, that's fine, but if you log

116
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,680
in using the Stephane account on the right hand side window

117
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,450
then you will be disconnected on the left hand side,

118
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,650
this is the only difference.

119
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,360
So to use two accounts at the same time,

120
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,030
the route on the left and my account on the right

121
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,779
what I'm doing as a trick is that I'm using a private window

122
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:47,899
on my web browser, and Chrome has this feature,

123
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:51,240
Firefox as this feature, Safari as this feature, and so on.

124
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,616
So by pasting the signing URL, as you can see,

125
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:56,267
I get the sign in and as an IAM user

126
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:59,713
and to get to this page, we can go back to one.

127
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:02,730
And as you can see, when you do a sign in on AWS,

128
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,360
you have the root user sign in or the IAM user sign in.

129
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,730
So to get back to this, we go to IAM user.

130
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,690
We enter either the account ID or the account alias

131
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,794
that I can copy in here, and then we are taken to this page.

132
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:19,260
So the IAM user name is going to be Stephane

133
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,774
and the password is going to be whatever you have set

134
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:25,574
from before, then you sign in.

135
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:28,920
So now the cool thing is that if I look

136
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,160
at the top right hand side, IAM logged in using my IAM user.

137
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,130
So it says the account ID and the IAM user.

138
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,630
But if I look on the top right hand side of here

139
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,010
it just says the account id

140
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,900
which shows me it's the root accounts.

141
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,970
So here we are, we have the root accounts logged

142
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,040
in on the left hand side through a normal window

143
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,250
and we have the IAM user logged in on the right hand side

144
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,050
through a private window.

145
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,660
Please make sure not to lose your root account

146
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,070
logins and your admin login.

147
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,320
Otherwise, you will be in deep trouble with your

148
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,140
account and you'll have to contact AWS for support.

149
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,230
And currently I cannot help you with this.

150
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,160
Now from a course perspective,

151
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,820
I recommend you use your IAM user and not your root user

152
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,380
but this is just a normal recommendation.

153
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,360
Sometimes you'll see me using root

154
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,340
sometimes I'm using IAM user.

155
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,560
But when you have to use roots or when you have

156
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,170
to use an IAM user, I will let you know in the course.

157
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,340
Don't worry about that.

158
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,600
Now for the rest of this section,

159
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,510
please keep these two windows open and I will

160
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,013
see you in the next lecture.
