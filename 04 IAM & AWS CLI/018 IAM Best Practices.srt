1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,520
So here are some general guidelines

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,520
on IAM and best practices, 'cause I don't want you

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,430
if you go to use AWS to make some mistakes.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,870
So do not use a root account

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,750
except when you set up your AWS account.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,360
So by now you should have two accounts, a root account

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,865
and your own personal accounts.

8
00:00:16,865 --> 00:00:21,420
And remember, one AWS user is equal to one physical user.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,905
So if a friend of yours wants to use AWS,

10
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:26,250
do not give them your credentials,

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,830
instead, create another user for them.

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,330
You can assign user to groups

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,490
and assign permission to groups to make sure

14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,781
that security is managed at the group level

15
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:37,560
and should create a strong password policy.

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,710
Also, if you can use and enforce the use

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,010
of multi-factor authentication or MFA to really guarantee

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,880
that your account is going to be safe or safer from hackers.

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,550
Then you should create and use roles whenever

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,980
you're giving permissions to AWS services,

21
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,990
and that includes easy two instances

22
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,820
which are virtual servers.

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,540
If you were to use AWS programmatically or using the CLI,

24
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,890
so the CLI or some SDK, you must generate access keys,

25
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,260
and these access keys are just like passwords,

26
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,130
they're very secret.

27
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,960
So just keep them for yourself.

28
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,850
To edit the permissions of your account,

29
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,890
you can use the IAM credentials reports

30
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,040
or the IAM Access advisor feature.

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,100
Finally, never, ever, ever share your IAM users

32
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,920
and access keys, I am very serious about it.

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,820
So that's it,

34
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,560
we are nearing the end of this section.

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,270
You know everything about IAM.

36
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,020
I will see you in the next lecture.
