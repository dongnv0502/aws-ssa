00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,920
So here is a summary for IAM.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,340
We've seen IAM users and they should be mapped

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,119
to an actual physical user within your company.

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,630
And this user will have a password for the AWS console.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,220
Now we can group these users into groups

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,120
and therefore users only.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,250
We can attach policies

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,480
or share JSON documents that outline the permission

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,640
for users or groups.

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,520
And we can also create roles

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,930
and these roles will be identities, but this time

12
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,340
for maybe EC2 instances or other AWS services.

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,890
We assume that for security

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,400
we can enable multi-factor authentication so MFA

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,610
and also set a password policy for our users.

16
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,570
We can use the CLI to manage your services

17
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,030
using the command line

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,750
or the SDK to manage your AWS services,

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,700
using a programming language.

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,550
Finally, we can create access keys to access AWS

21
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,150
using the CLI or the SDK.

22
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,450
And finally, we can audit our IAM usage

23
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,830
by creating an IAM credentials report

24
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,250
and also using the IAM access advisor service.

25
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,320
So that's it for this lecture.

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,310
I hope you liked it.

27
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,260
And I will see you in the next lecture.
