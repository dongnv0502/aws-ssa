1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,810
So we have seen how to access AWS

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,200
using the Management console,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,150
which is the Web interface that we've done

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,160
so far in this course, but there are, actually,

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,060
three different options to access AWS.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,420
So the first one is a Management console,

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,580
as we've seen, and is protected by your username,

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,670
password, maybe multifactor authentication.

9
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,420
Then there is the CLI, Command Line Interface,

10
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,500
and this is something we will set up on our computer,

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,500
and this is protected by access keys,

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,550
and access keys our credentials we're going to download

13
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,409
in a few seconds that will allow us

14
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,380
to access AWS from our terminal.

15
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,053
Then, finally, there is the SDK,

16
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:41,460
the AWS Software Development Kit,

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,950
which is used whenever you want to call APIs from AWS

18
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,340
from within your application code.

19
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,432
And again, these will be protected

20
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:52,090
by the exact same access keys.

21
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,840
So how do we generate access keys?

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,180
Well we will do this through the Management console,

23
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,600
and users are responsible for their own access keys,

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,650
and access keys, from the user perspective,

25
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,879
there are secret, just like a password,

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,290
so if you generate your own access keys

27
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,260
do not share them with your colleagues,

28
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,090
because they can generate their own access keys as well.

29
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,170
So really make sure that you treat your access key ID

30
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,540
just like your username,

31
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,970
and your secret access key just like your password,

32
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,820
you do not share them with other people.

33
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,240
So when you go into the Management console,

34
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,880
you get access key as there's a button

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,700
to create access keys, and then it gives you the right

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,420
to download it in the very second.

37
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,270
And so, for example, here's a fake access key ID

38
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,440
and a fake secret access key,

39
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,960
and these, when loaded into my Command Line Interface,

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,490
would allow me to access the AWS API,

41
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,200
and we'll do this in the hands-on in a second.

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,980
So again, remember, I want to make sure

43
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,210
that you don't have any security issues

44
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,200
while doing this course or at work,

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,493
do not share your access keys, they are private to you.

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,130
So if you're new to the Cloud, and programming and so on,

47
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,200
or IT, then you might not know what's a CLI.

48
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,740
So CLI stands for Command Line Interface,

49
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,420
and the AWS CLI is a tool that allows you to interact

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,789
with the AWS services using commands

51
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,880
from your command-line shell.

52
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,930
So whenever you see some code where you type a command line,

53
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,090
and then it returns a result, for example,

54
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,710
aws, s3, cp, and so on, this is what we call the CLI.

55
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,580
And we are using the AWS CLI

56
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,557
because we start every command by the word AWS.

57
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,060
Now with this CLI, you get direct access

58
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,383
to the public APIs of your AWS services

59
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:33,050
which is going to be very helpful in this course.

60
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,470
And, then, using the CLI you can develop scripts

61
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,540
to manage your resources and automate some of your tasks.

62
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,680
The CLI is open-source,

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,910
you can find all the source code on GitHub,

64
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,670
and it is an alternative to using

65
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,270
the AWS Management console.

66
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,540
I know that some people, actually,

67
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,830
do not even use the Management console,

68
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,160
they only use the CLI, for example.

69
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,830
So what's the SDK now?

70
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,440
SDK stands for Software Development Kit,

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,170
and this is a set of library,

72
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,030
this is going to be language specific,

73
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,170
so you're going to have an SDK

74
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,070
for different programming languages,

75
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,725
and similarly, it will allow you to access and manage

76
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:07,970
your AWS services and APIs programmatically,

77
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,550
but this time the SDK is not something that you use

78
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,940
within your terminal, it is something that you embed

79
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,410
within your application that you have to code.

80
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,327
So your application will have the AWS SDK

81
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:19,400
from within them.

82
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,198
It supports many different programming languages,

83
00:03:21,198 --> 00:03:24,240
such as JavaScript, Python, PHP.NET,

84
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,640
Ruby, Java, Go, Node.js, C++,

85
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,830
all of that's our programming languages.

86
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,550
There's also the mobile SDK,

87
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,390
if you're using Android or iOS,

88
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,540
and the IoT, so Internet of Things device SDK

89
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,950
in case you're using some thermal sensors

90
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,920
or backlogs that are connected, all these kinds of things.

91
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,100
So to give you an example of what you can build

92
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,820
with the SDK, well the AWS CLI that we're going to be using

93
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,910
in this course is actually built

94
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,900
on the AWS SDK for Python named Boto.

95
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,720
So that's it for this lecture.

96
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,592
Now in then the next lecture, we're going to practice

97
00:03:57,592 --> 00:04:01,460
setting up the CLI and dealing with access keys,

98
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,360
so I will see you in the next lecture.
