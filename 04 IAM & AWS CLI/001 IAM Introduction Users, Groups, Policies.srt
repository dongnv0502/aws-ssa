00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,650
- [Stephane] Welcome
to the first deep dive

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,220
on an iterator service.

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,920
The first one is called IAM.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,210
So IAM stands for identity
and access management.

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,860
It is a global service because in IAM,

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,330
we are going to create our
users and assign them to group.

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,430
So we've already used IAM without knowing,

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,970
when we created an account,
we created a root accounts,

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,420
and has been created by default.

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,570
This is the root user of our accounts.

11
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,800
And the only things you
should use it for is

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,830
to set up your account
as we'll do it right now.

13
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,620
But then you shouldn't
use that account anymore,

14
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,110
or even share it.

15
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,250
What you should be doing
instead, is create users.

16
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,410
So you will create users in IAM,

17
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,060
and one user represents one
person within your organization.

18
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,960
And the users can be grouped
together if it makes sense.

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,770
So let's take an example
we have an organization

20
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,870
with six people.

21
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,160
You have Alice, Bob,
Charles, David, Edward

22
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,440
and Fred so all these people
are in your organization.

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,130
Now Alice, Bob, and
Charles they work together.

24
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,440
They're all developers.

25
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,530
So we're going to create a group called

26
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,940
the group developers who regrouping Alice,

27
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,050
Bob and Charles.

28
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,500
And it turns out that David
and Edward also work together.

29
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,090
So we're going to create
an operations group.

30
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,950
Now we have two groups within IAM.

31
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,610
Now groups can only contain
users, not other groups.

32
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,620
So this is something very
important to understand.

33
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,720
Groups only contain users.

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,750
Now, some users don't
have to belong to a group.

35
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,110
For example, Fred right here is alone,

36
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,280
he does not correspond to any group.

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,460
That is not best practice.

38
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,350
But it is something you can do in AWS.

39
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,080
And also, a user can
belong to multiple groups.

40
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,130
That means that for example,
if you know that Charles

41
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,420
and David worked together,

42
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,440
and they're part of your audit team,

43
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,710
you can create a third group
with Charles and David.

44
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,710
And as you can see, now, in this example,

45
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,770
Charles and David are part
of two different groups.

46
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,270
So this is the possible
configurations for IAM.

47
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,730
So why do we create users
and why do we create groups?

48
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,160
Well, because we want to allow
them to use our AWS accounts

49
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,940
and to allow them to do so,

50
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,960
we have to give them permissions.

51
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,490
So users or groups can be assigned

52
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,900
what's called a JSON document.

53
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,770
I'll show you right now what
it means called a policy,

54
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,090
an IAM policy.

55
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,820
So it looks just like this.

56
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,170
So you don't have to be a programmer.

57
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,130
This is not programming.

58
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,560
This is just describing
in, I think plain English,

59
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,640
what a user is allowed
to do or what a group

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,120
and all the users within
that group are allowed to do.

61
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,030
So in this example, we can
see that we allow people

62
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,030
to use the EC2 to service
and do describe on it,

63
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,630
to use the elastic load balancing service

64
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,260
and to describe on it
and to use CloudWatch.

65
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,800
Now we'll see what EC2
elastic load balancing

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,210
and CloudWatch mean, but
through this JSON document

67
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,490
that looks just like this.

68
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,800
We are allowing our users
to use some services in AWS.

69
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,240
So these policies will
help us define permissions

70
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,830
of our users.

71
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,380
And so in AWS, you don't allow
everyone to do everything

72
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,720
that would be catastrophic,

73
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,320
because a new user could
basically launch so many services

74
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,840
and they will cost you a lot of money

75
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,500
or would be valid for security.

76
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,660
So in AWS, you apply a principle called

77
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,600
the least privilege principle.

78
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,210
So you don't give more
permissions than a user needs.

79
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,240
Okay, so if a user just needs
access to three services,

80
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,830
just create a permission for that user.

81
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,460
So now we have seen an overview IAM.

82
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,830
Let's go in the next lecture

83
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,510
to practice creating users and groups.
