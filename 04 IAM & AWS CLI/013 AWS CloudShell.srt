1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
Okay.

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:03,360
So I would like to talk to you about an alternative

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,480
to using the terminal to issue commands against AWS.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,600
And this is using cloud shell.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,020
So cloud shell is this icon right here on the top

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,210
right corner of your screen.

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,330
And if you don't see it, just make sure you check

8
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,216
out the clutch shell availability regions

9
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:19,060
because it's not available everywhere.

10
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,950
And so if you go to the clash of FAC, you can see

11
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,910
that there are some regions that's not available.

12
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,940
So let's have a look right now with the regions.

13
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,580
Here we go. Question three.

14
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,720
Right now that's, I'm recording.

15
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,690
It's only available in one of these regions.

16
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,810
So by the way, I would recommend if you want to follow

17
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,800
along to just use one of these regions, then

18
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,270
so we can use cloud shell, but if you don't use cloud shell

19
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,500
in this hands-on, that is completely fine.

20
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,610
If the terminal was working for you, do not worry.

21
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,443
You're good to go.

22
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:48,290
Okay. So we have cloud shell in here and within cloud shell

23
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,410
you could take a minute maybe to launch your environment.

24
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,430
You can issue commands.

25
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,400
For example, you can issue the AWS commands.

26
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,550
So as you can see is installed, if I do

27
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,870
either of us management is version, as we can see

28
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,990
I'm on version two.one right now using cloud shell.

29
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,950
So cloud shell is basically a terminal in the cloud of AWS.

30
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,783
That's free to use.

31
00:01:07,783 --> 00:01:10,120
Okay. So the cool thing about cloud shell is

32
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,430
that whenever you are using the CLI, so for example

33
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,440
it was am list users.

34
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,910
This is going to return for you an API call

35
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,610
as if the credentials being used, where the credentials

36
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,260
of the accounts of you using the cloud right now

37
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,830
which is why the API calls are working.

38
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,792
And by default, you can specify any kind

39
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:31,360
of region you want to do.

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,140
The API call using the management is region arguments, but

41
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,320
in cloud shell, the default region is going to

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,950
be the region you're currently in

43
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,780
logged in right now in cloud shell.

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,100
So this is another thing that's good to know.

45
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,260
Okay. Other things that you should know

46
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,220
about cloud shell is that you have a full repository.

47
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,630
So for example, right now, as we can see

48
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,680
we have zero files within cloud shell.

49
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,065
But if you just do

50
00:01:52,065 --> 00:01:53,690
echo

51
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,523
tests

52
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:58,400
into demo dot TXT, this is going to create a text

53
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,660
file that contains the word texts tests.

54
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,750
And so it turns out that

55
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,430
if you happen to restart your cloud shell

56
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,890
then this file will stick.

57
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,889
So all the files you are creating

58
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,530
within your cultural environment, for example

59
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,530
this demo that's TXT are going to stay.

60
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,930
And the other cool thing you can do

61
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,640
about cloud shell is that you can configure it.

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,150
So you can say what font size you want, smallest

63
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,983
medium and large.

64
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:23,620
And so on the tech, the theme you want, so light or dark

65
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,280
if he wants safe based or nuts.

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,250
So resist like a bigger cloud shell for me right now.

67
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,880
And also you have the possibility to download

68
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,110
and upload files.

69
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,260
So for example, if I want you to get the full path

70
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,630
to my file, so did this demo let's six.

71
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,530
I can just copy it right now.

72
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,210
Action and download foul, and then do demo dot TXT.

73
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,320
And this will go ahead and download the file for me.

74
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,700
And alternatively, you could upload your own files

75
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,160
into your cultural environments.

76
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,900
So I want to show you these handy options

77
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,120
because for me, they are lifesavers.

78
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,953
Okay.

79
00:02:53,953 --> 00:02:56,240
And finally, if you wanted more tabs into this environment

80
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,170
you could have a new tab.

81
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,120
You can split into column example, and there you go.

82
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,420
You have two terminals

83
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,730
into cloud shell connected at the same time.

84
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,230
So really that once show you the power

85
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,440
of cloud shell in this hands-on again, you're doing it.

86
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,390
You know, all the commands that data just wants to show you.

87
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,300
If you're a power user, then you can do these commands

88
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,640
and how they would work with cloud shell.

89
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,460
So the bottom line for this lecture again, is number one

90
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,320
cloud shell is only available in some regions.

91
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,810
So maybe try to choose one

92
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,680
of the regions where cloud shell is available.

93
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,610
If you want to use it, if you don't want to use cloud shell

94
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,560
or cloud shell is not working for you.

95
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,080
This is completely fine.

96
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,470
As long as you use the terminal, the way we configured it

97
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,250
from before, this will work just fine.

98
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,670
And you'll be fine in the course to either use cloud shell

99
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,850
or your terminal to perform the commands

100
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,980
with the CLA against AWS.

101
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,580
Okay. And also remember that I really like the upload

102
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,340
and download feature of cloud shell

103
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,350
choose to upload files and download files from it.

104
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,330
Okay. So that's it for this lecture.

105
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,163
I hope you liked it.

106
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:53,110
And I will see you in the next lecture.
