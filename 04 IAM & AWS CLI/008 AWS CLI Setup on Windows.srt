1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,320
Okay so we are going to install

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,860
the aws command line on Windows.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,890
So for this we do aws CLI install windows on Google.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,510
And this will give us the list link

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,870
and we want to install the aws-cli version 2 on Windows.

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,780
Okay this is the latest and so we'll up to dates.

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,960
It doesn't change much versus version 1,

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,860
it is just some improved performance and capability,

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,726
but the API's exactly the same

10
00:00:23,726 --> 00:00:26,770
and there's also an improved installer.

11
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,360
So I'm going to scroll down,

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,800
in here and to Install on Windows

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,229
where you can just simply

14
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:35,790
install it using the MSI installer,

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,150
so I just click on this link to download the MSI installer.

16
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,110
then I'm going to run the installer

17
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,430
so it should very very simple.

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,270
Now the installer is starting,

19
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,370
I click on Next.

20
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,350
I accept the terms of the license,

21
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,260
click on Next,

22
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,700
Install and then we wait for the installer to be done.

23
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,500
Yes, I want to allow whatever this is doing.

24
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,880
Okay so the installer is now complete.

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,290
I click on Finish

26
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,030
and now I can go ahead and open a command line,

27
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,990
so I'll do command line,

28
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,730
Command Prompt here we go on Windows,

29
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,630
and to be sure that it's fully installed

30
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,273
I just type aws--version

31
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,630
and press enter,

32
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,456
and if you get a result like this:

33
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:20,350
aws-cli, a version that starts with a 2,

34
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,070
then Python, Windows,

35
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,900
that means that your aws-cli

36
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,700
is now properly installed on Windows

37
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,080
and you're good to go.

38
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,310
Finally just note that if you want to upgrade your aws-cli

39
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,900
then you just need to re-download that MSI installer

40
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,680
and just re-run the install

41
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,000
and it will be automatically upgraded.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,330
But as soon as you have this output you're good to go

43
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,920
and you can follow me in the next lecture.

44
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,470
So see you in the next lecture.
