1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,350
So we are going to first,

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,270
define a password policy.

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,730
For this, click on account settings on the left-hand side.

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,240
You will find password policy and you can edit it.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,920
So here, we can use the IAM default password policy,

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,789
which composes of these kind of requirements,

7
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:16,389
or we can customize the password policy

8
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:19,170
and force a password minimum length.

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,668
We can also require uppercase letter, lowercase letter,

10
00:00:21,668 --> 00:00:25,380
a number, a non-alphanumeric character.

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,840
We can also turn on password expiration to turn on,

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,680
for example, expire after 90 days,

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,159
or that a password expiration

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,610
requires administrative resets, or we can allow the users

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,690
to change their own password

16
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,300
or we can prevent password reuse.

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,430
So this password process can be edited directly

18
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,050
from the IAM console, and that's the first part of security.

19
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,030
The second part

20
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,298
is around setting multi-factor authentication

21
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:50,228
for your root account.

22
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:51,858
So if you click on the account name

23
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:55,936
and then click on security credentials, if you are logged in

24
00:00:55,936 --> 00:00:57,930
with the root user,

25
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,350
you will see my security credentials root user.

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,655
Now, there is a way for you

27
00:01:02,655 --> 00:01:05,010
to actually protect your root user,

28
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,258
which is the most important account in your AWS account,

29
00:01:09,258 --> 00:01:12,868
and you can protect it by using multi-factor authentication.

30
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:15,330
Now, just so you know, I'm going to do it

31
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,028
and demonstrate how it works in front of you,

32
00:01:17,028 --> 00:01:19,740
but I've had students who locked themselves out

33
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,230
of their accounts because they lost access

34
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,720
to their multi-factor authentication device.

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,630
As such, if you think you are running the risk

36
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,840
of losing your iPhone or whatever, do not do this, okay?

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,870
Just keep your phone with you, just watch my video.

38
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,180
It will be good enough if you want to practice along

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,290
with me, you can as well.

40
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,348
And you can also delete the MFA device after activating it.

41
00:01:40,348 --> 00:01:44,520
Okay, but let's go ahead and assign an MFA device.

42
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,950
So I will call this one my iPhone

43
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,900
because this is what I have, but you can name it

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,973
whatever you want.

45
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:52,440
Then you can select the type of MFA device.

46
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,240
So it could be an authenticator app,

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,710
which is something I'm going to use,

48
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,420
but also it can be a security key or a hardware TOTP token.

49
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,040
So I'm going to use an authenticator app

50
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,630
because it will be virtual.

51
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,983
And now we go into the setup of the app.

52
00:02:05,983 --> 00:02:09,000
So there's a list of compatible applications right here.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,250
You can find here for Android

54
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,090
and for iOS that we know work well with AWS.

55
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,950
And as such, I'm going to use the Twilio

56
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,303
of the Authenticator, which is an app I like.

57
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:22,920
So what I have to do then is actually launch the app

58
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,580
on my phone and then you click on show QR code.

59
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,690
So when you should a QR code, you need

60
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,271
to scan this QR code directly on your phone.

61
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:31,901
So for this, you add an account,

62
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,421
you scan the QR code right here,

63
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:38,130
and once scanned, it will add the account

64
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,450
and start naming it.

65
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,460
So we'll just save this, this looks good.

66
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,380
And then we get access to MFA code.

67
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,380
So there is first, the first MFA code, so 301935.

68
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,080
So this is a code generated by my iPhone in real-time.

69
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,880
And this code is going to change over time.

70
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,640
And the reason why these two codes are asked by AWS

71
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,692
is that it wants to make sure that the MFA device

72
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:04,754
is set up correctly and that the codes are accurate.

73
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:08,640
So the second code is 792843.

74
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,970
And, of course, there will be difference for your device.

75
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,936
And once these two codes are entered, you click on add MFA.

76
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:17,010
And as you can see, we can reach there up

77
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,160
to eight MFA devices currently, and you can scroll down

78
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,570
and see them right here on the list.

79
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,810
So the multi-factor authentication, MFA, one,

80
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,940
it's called my iPhone that's been created right now.

81
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,090
So if you wanted to remove it, you can remove it and so on.

82
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,680
But so how do we use MFA?

83
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,113
Well now, if I log out of AWS

84
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,450
and I log back in, so I'm going

85
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,063
to use my router account and my password.

86
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,390
Now after doing a successful login,

87
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,460
I have the MFA code to enter.

88
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,600
And so I open my app

89
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,980
and enter the code that I see and press submit.

90
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,350
And this way IAM logged in.

91
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,660
And this is perfect because well, we had an extra level

92
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,490
of security on our account.

93
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,930
So that's it for this lecture.

94
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,963
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
