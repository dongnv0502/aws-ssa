1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,110
Okay, so let's proceed

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,800
with installing the AWS CLI on Linux.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,290
So for this I just google it, and I will choose installing

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,600
the AWS CLI Version 2 on Linux because

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,210
this is the latest one,

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,670
and I'm going to scroll down.

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,430
And to install the CLI it goes installing.

8
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,560
We just have to run these three commands.

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,170
So the first one is to get a Zip file.

10
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,370
So I copy this, go into a terminal,

11
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,290
and then I will paste it.

12
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,410
And here we go.

13
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,420
So this has been pasted, and it is downloading currently

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,760
the installer.

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,330
The next thing we have to do is to unzip it.

16
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,920
So I copy this command and paste it,

17
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,160
and this will unzip my installer.

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,110
Great.

19
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,290
And the last thing is to run the installer as root,

20
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,470
so I'll do sudo and then install.

21
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,180
This should prompt me for my password,

22
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,370
which I enter right now,

23
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,568
and then the installation proceed.

24
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:54,537
Now it says you can run,

25
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:57,560
"user/local/bin/AWS minus minus version,"

26
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,490
or very simply, "AWS minus minus version"

27
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,340
if your user local bin is in your path,

28
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,400
and there we go.

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,640
The AWS CLI has been installed as you can see.

30
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,182
It says AWS CLI/2.

31
00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:11,940
and then you are getting a different version based on

32
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,842
when you do this.

33
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:15,259
And then you get Python and Linux and Botocore,

34
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:16,330
so you are good to go.

35
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,372
When this works we can run any command on the AWS CLI

36
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:22,480
and you can go ahead, with the rest of the lectures.

37
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,650
If you got ant issues please read this

38
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,270
and it will tell you what's going on and that it,

39
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,020
I will see you in the next lecture.
