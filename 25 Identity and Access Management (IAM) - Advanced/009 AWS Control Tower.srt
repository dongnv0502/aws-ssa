1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,133
So now let's talk

2
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:03,719
about the AWS Control Tower service.

3
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,420
So it's a very easy way for you to set up and govern

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,960
a secure and compliant multi-account AWS environment

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,580
based on best practices.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,100
So actually to create these accounts,

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,360
well, the Control Tower service

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,630
is going to use the AWS Organization service

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,450
and then the accounts are automatically being created

10
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,830
and we'll see in the next slide

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,380
how to make them secure and compliant.

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,450
And so the benefits of using a Control Tower

13
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,550
is that you automate the set up

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,260
of your environments in a few clicks

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,200
and you have all your configs you want in advance.

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,520
Then you can automate

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,560
ongoing policy management using guardrails.

18
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,210
I will show you this in the next slide.

19
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,370
You can detect policy violations

20
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,500
and remediate them automatically,

21
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,750
and you can monitor the overall compliance

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,380
of all your accounts through an interactive dashboard.

23
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,830
So it's yet another service on top of organizations.

24
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,240
So what are these guardrails?

25
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,450
So say you set up multiple accounts on AWS,

26
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,850
but you want to restrict all of them at once

27
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,900
for certain kind of things,

28
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,460
or you want to monitor the compliance

29
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,379
for certain kind of things.

30
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,550
So using these guardrails,

31
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,310
you're going to get ongoing governance for all your accounts

32
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,620
within your Control Tower environments.

33
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,080
So you have two kinds of guardrails.

34
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,930
The first one is called a preventive guardrail.

35
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,200
And so it's to prevent accounts from doing something

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,150
and therefore they're restrictive.

37
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,020
And so we're going to use SCP, so Service Control Policies,

38
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,720
from the AWS Organization service

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,430
to apply them to all our accounts.

40
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,490
For example, we could create a preventive guardrail

41
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,340
to restrict regions across all your accounts to say,

42
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,670
hey, you should only operate in the us-east-1

43
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,740
in the eu-west-2 regions.

44
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,330
And so therefore behind the scenes,

45
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,560
Control Tower is going to tell organizations to use SCPs.

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,660
The second kind of guardrail we have

47
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,610
is a detective guardrail.

48
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,790
So this time, we want to just detect non-compliance.

49
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,860
And because I talk to you about compliance,

50
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,830
of course, it's using the AWS Config service.

51
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,550
For example, we want to identify untagged resources

52
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,690
in our accounts.

53
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,980
So we have Control Tower

54
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,710
and we set up a detective guardrail.

55
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,110
And so it's going to use Config

56
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,009
and Config is going to be deployed

57
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,870
on all your member accounts

58
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,730
and is going through the rules,

59
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,280
monitor any untagged resources.

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,110
In case anything is non-compliant,

61
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,180
it's going to trigger an SNS topic.

62
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,150
So we could be notified as an administrator

63
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,960
or the SNS topic can also invoke a Lambda function.

64
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,890
And the Lambda function

65
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,260
can automatically remediate the action

66
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,530
and add tags to your untagged resources.

67
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,580
So we've seen Control Tower,

68
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,220
we've seen how it can generate new accounts

69
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,570
and how we can have guardrails,

70
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,870
either preventive or detective, to control the security

71
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,450
and the compliance of our environments.

72
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,920
So I hope you like this lecture

73
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,870
and I will see you in the next lecture.
