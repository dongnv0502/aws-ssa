1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,530
So, if you go to the console

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,390
and type directory service,

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,430
we can see the different options offered to us.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,260
I'll just go through them at a high level

5
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,440
because they can be complicated to set up individually.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,940
But so we have four options

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,190
and actually the fourth one is Amazon Cognito User Pool,

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,560
which is redirecting you to the Cognito service.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,680
So, don't count this into directory services.

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,200
So we have AWS managed Microsoft ID

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,150
where we can have an active directory

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,310
that's going to be integrated with AWS Cloud

13
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,050
and can have a trust relationship

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,580
with your on-premise directory.

15
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,460
And to set it up, you can see it's two additions.

16
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,160
The Standard Edition up to 30,000 objects

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,460
or the Enterprise Edition up to 500,000 objects.

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,020
So, a lot more.

19
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,420
And then you need to set it up and I won't go over the setup

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,800
because this is more AD specific

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,720
and you don't need to know this for the exam.

22
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,610
This next one is Simple AD

23
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,130
which is going to be a standalone managed directory

24
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,100
that has a active directory compatible API

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,120
but it cannot be connected

26
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,190
to your on-premise active directory.

27
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,380
Or AD Connector which is a proxy

28
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,030
for redirecting directory request

29
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,540
to your existing Microsoft Active Directory on-premise.

30
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,670
And it's designed for, you have two levels.

31
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,770
You have a connector for up to 500 users

32
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,160
or you have a connector for up to 5,000 users, okay?

33
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,020
So remember the first one supports MFA.

34
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,340
The second one is just standalone

35
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,440
and AD Connector is a proxy.

36
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,730
All right, that's it for this lecture.

37
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,480
I will see you in the next lecture.
