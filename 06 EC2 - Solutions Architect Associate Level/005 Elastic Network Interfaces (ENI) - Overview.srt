1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,318
Okay now lets talk about

2
00:00:02,318 --> 00:00:03,800
Elastic Network Interfaces or ENI.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,950
So if you hear me say ENI I mean

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,740
Elastic Network Interfaces.

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,310
They're a logical component in a VPC

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,260
and they represent a virtual network card.

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,210
So they're what gives EC2 Instances access to the network,

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,730
but they're used outside EC2 Instances as well

9
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,660
as we'll see later in this course.

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,250
So for example we have an availability zone

11
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,380
and we have one EC2 Instance

12
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,870
and to it is attached on eth0, your primary ENI

13
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,510
and this will provide your EC2 Instance network connectivity

14
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,870
and for example, a private IP.

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,930
So each ENI can have the following attributes.

16
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,210
Number one it can have a Primary private IPv4

17
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,950
and one or more secondary IPv4. Okay.

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,940
So in this example, I have one of zero but

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,270
you are more than welcomed to add a secondary ENI to EC2

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,639
and that will be eth1

21
00:00:55,639 --> 00:01:00,250
and this will give you another private IPv4 as well, okay. `

22
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,250
Each ENI can also have an elastic IPv4 per private IPv4

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,930
or one or more public IPv4,

24
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,330
so it gives you a private and a public IP

25
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,800
as will see in the hands-on.

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,110
You can have one or more security groups attached

27
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,400
to your ENI.

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,390
You can have a Mac address attached to it

29
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,140
and other things but I've just give you

30
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,640
the most important bits right now in this lecture.

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,660
And you can create ENI's independently from

32
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,870
your EC2 instances

33
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,160
and attach them on the fly

34
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,560
or move them from EC2 instances for failover.

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,370
So, let's have a look at what it looks like.

36
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,740
And by the way, they're bounded

37
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,352
to a specific availability zone or AZ.

38
00:01:37,352 --> 00:01:40,020
So that means that if you create a ENI in the specific AZ,

39
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,610
you can only have it bound to that specific AZ.

40
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,410
So here's another issue to instance

41
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,130
and it has another ENI attached to it.

42
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,040
And for example, we can do is we can move eth1

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,740
from the first EC2 instance into the second EC2 Instance

44
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,650
to move that private IP.

45
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,170
And what it means is that that private IP will change

46
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,790
from the first issue to instance

47
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,970
and will be attached to the second EC2 Instance.

48
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,110
And it's very very helpful for failovers.

49
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,070
For example, if you're easy to instance is accessed

50
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,229
by a private static IP,

51
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,770
then you can move the IP around between

52
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,750
these two instances for failover purposes, okay.

53
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,870
So let's have a look in the hands-on

54
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,310
to see what it looks like.
