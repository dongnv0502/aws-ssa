00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:08,740
This section is one of the most important one the exam will ask you lots of question about security.

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:14,270
Now you may have noticed in all the previous lectures I have talked about security quite a bit.

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:20,350
I said how different AWS services were integrated with security and I'm sure you get a good idea of it but

4
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:25,750
I wanted to dedicate a whole section just to reflect on what we learn and learn about the KMS properly

5
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:32,000
encryption properly, the parameters store and so on. This section

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,340
should really bring light to everything you've seen on the security side.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,310
I hope you like it.

8
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,050
It is very real world oriented.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,900
And we're going to practice stuff with AWS Lambda.

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,760
So let's go and learn about security.
